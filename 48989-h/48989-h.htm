<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

<a name="WHAT_I_FOUND_IN_THE_WOOD" id="WHAT_I_FOUND_IN_THE_WOOD">WHAT I FOUND IN THE WOOD</a></h3>


<p>In all that I shall set down here, in telling the
strange story of my poor life, I shall write nothing
but the truth. It has been written in many odd times
and in many odd places: in a prison cell, on paper
stamped with the prison mark; on odd scraps of
paper in a lonely garret under the stars, with a candle-end
for light&mdash;and I, poor and old and shivering&mdash;scrawling
hastily because the time was so short. I
have been at once the meanest and the greatest of all
men; the meanest&mdash;because all men shuddered at
the mere mention of my name, and at the thought of
what I had done; the greatest&mdash;because one woman
loved me, and taught me that beyond that nothing
else mattered. I have lived in God's sunlight, and in
the sunlight of her eyes; I have gone down into the
Valley of the Shadow of Death, and have not been
afraid; I have been caged like a wild beast, until I
forgot the world, just as the world forgot me. In a
mere matter of the counting of years I am but little
past forty years of age; yet I am an old man, and I
have lived two lives&mdash;just as, when my time comes,
I shall have died two deaths. I have touched the
warm lips of Love; I have clasped the gaunt hands of
Misery. I have warmed both hands at the fire of
Life; but now the fire has gone out, and only the cold
grey ashes remain. But of all that you may read,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
just as I have written it, and as the memory of it has
come back to me. Roll up the curtain&mdash;and see me
as I was&mdash;and judge me lightly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not necessary that you should hear what manner
of boy I was, nor how I impressed those with whom I
came in contact. I have no recollection of my parents;
they died, perhaps mercifully for them, when I was
quite young. I went to school in the ordinary way;
I would not have you think that I was anything but
an ordinary boy. A little dreamy, perhaps, and introspective;
with those hopes and high ideals that come
to youth generally a little stronger in my case than in
that of most boys. I had a very decent fortune, left
in the hands of a highly respectable guardian; for the
rest, apart from the mere matter of education, I discovered
pretty early that I was to be left to my own
devices, it being considered sufficient that I should
grow up as a gentleman, and should please myself. I
think now that if I had had some guiding will stronger
than my own, I might never have done what I did,
and I might now be a highly respectable citizen, respected
by those who knew me, and with a life of easy
contentment spreading itself fairly about my feet.
Instead of which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had made up my mind to be an artist; to that
direction all my thoughts and dreams and ideas tended.
I would paint great pictures; I would wander through
the cities of the world, and see the pictures other men
had painted; I would live a life that had in it nothing
of commercialism, and nothing of the sordid. I did
not know then how circumstances mould a life and
change it; how rough-fingered Fate can step in,
and tear asunder in a moment the fair threads we have
woven, and twist and tangle them, and ruin the fabric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Like many another poor fool before me, I told myself
that I could do what I liked with my life, and shape it
in what fashion I would.</p>

<p>Up to this time&mdash;that is, the time when I began to
think for myself, and to take my life into my own
hands&mdash;I had not met my guardian. I had had one
or two curt and business-like notes from him during
my schooldays; and when I went to London I found
that he had taken a lodging for me, and had made
various arrangements for my future. He was a little
contemptuous as to the profession I had adopted;
but shrugged his shoulders, and suggested that it was
no real concern of his. I met him first, on my coming
to London, at his office in the City&mdash;an office in a
narrow dingy court, where he was in a position of some
authority as manager to a big firm. I know nothing
of business, and knew nothing then; I only know that
he received me in a private room, and that I had a dim
understanding that in another room still more private
was one greater than himself, to whom he looked for
instructions, just as all those below him looked to him.
Jervis Fanshawe, with half a dozen little white stops
let into the edge of the big desk at which he sat, to
enable him to communicate with his subordinates,
was evidently a power to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>I think, in that moment when I first saw the man,
that I knew instinctively I did not like him. He
was leaning forward across the great desk, with his
arms stretched out upon it, and with a paper-knife
balanced between his hands lengthwise; he seemed
to be summing me up, and making up his mind about
me. He was a man of about thirty-five, inclined
to baldness, and with a long clean-shaven face; he
gave one the impression that if he had allowed his beard
to grow, it would have been singularly black. His
nose was long and thin, with rather wide nostrils;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and there was a deep cut in the very centre of his chin.
Altogether it was a strong face, and a sinister.</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel uncomfortable when at last
he dropped the paper-knife, and stood up to shake
hands with me. "So you are Charles Avaline?"
he said. "I'm glad to see you. How old are you?
I forget times and dates."</p>

<p>"I shall be twenty in a month," I replied, "but I
feel much older."</p>

<p>"Most people do at your age," he retorted. "Well&mdash;there
are certain arrangements to be made about
your future&mdash;your income, and so on"&mdash;he was looking
down at the desk, and shifting some papers about
uneasily there&mdash;"and perhaps it would be better if
you came round to my rooms to-night to see me. I've
got an old-fashioned place in Bloomsbury; perhaps
you'll dine with me there. I'll write the address down
for you; seven sharp, please."</p>

<p>I felt myself dismissed, and went away, to make
acquaintance with that London that I felt was to be
my home for some considerable time to come. Boy
that I was, I wandered its streets happily enough for
the greater part of the day, feeling that this was my
kingdom, and that I had come into full possession of
it already. Here I was to work, and live, and dream,
and be happy. I have thought since of that day&mdash;dreamed
those dreams again&mdash;and laughed to think
that it was really to be the one day in all my life that
I was to see London with those eyes at all.</p>

<p>It was a fine night, and I walked to Bloomsbury;
having some difficulty in finding it, because my pride
forbade that I should appear a country bumpkin,
unacquainted with London, and under the necessity
of asking my way. Coming to the house hurriedly
and a little late, I saw a man who had been going along
before me mounting the steps of the house, and tugging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
at the bell. Having rung, he turned about, with
his hands on his hips, and with a cane in one hand
resting against his hip, and surveyed me, as I waited
a couple of steps below him, awkwardly enough, for
the door to open. He had the advantage of being
bigger and older than I was, to say nothing of the two
steps upon which he was mounted.</p>

<p>He was a big young man, some ten years older than
myself; very well dressed, and with a swaggering air
upon him that made me even then feel my blood tingle
a little. He stared down at me, and pulled at a little
dark moustache he wore; and then looked over my
head. I was glad when the door was at last opened,
and when he faced about, and marched in.</p>

<p>There was another uncomfortable pause, in a room
that was apparently my guardian's sitting-room, until
my guardian put in an appearance; a pause during
which the big young man and myself wandered about
uncomfortably, and looked at the few pictures, or
stared out of the window. Then Jervis Fanshawe
came in, and introduced us.</p>

<p>"This is a&mdash;a friend of mine&mdash;Mr. Gavin Hockley,"
he said, glancing at the other man a little resentfully,
as I thought. "My ward&mdash;Mr. Avaline." The young
man glanced at me for a moment, and nodded, and
turned away. "We can go in to dinner; we're a small
party&mdash;but none the worse for that, I hope."</p>

<p>It was not a cheerful dinner, by any means. We sat
round a circular table, and were waited upon by a
silent, elderly woman, who was evidently very much
afraid of Mr. Fanshawe. The dinner was plain and
substantial, and I was young and hungry; the wines,
I believe, were good, although I was no judge of that
particular department. I only know that the man
Hockley drank a great deal, and told some stories I
did not understand, and some that I understood only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
too well. He absolutely ignored me, even when I made
a remark (which was but seldom), and he talked to my
guardian with an easy insolent familiarity that I did
not then understand. Strangely, too, my guardian
seemed to defer to him in all matters, and to be afraid
of contradicting even the most outrageous statement.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking," said Hockley, towards the close of
the dinner, and pausing for a moment, with his glass
held near to his lips&mdash;"I'm thinking of going down to
Hammerstone Market again."</p>

<p>I saw that Jervis Fanshawe looked up at him quickly;
when he replied, he spoke more sharply than he had
yet done. "What for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of going down&mdash;for the fishing,"
replied Hockley; and as I looked at him I saw that
his face was creased in a grin, and that he was watching
Fanshawe. "That is, of course," he added, with a
guffaw, "my sort of fishing."</p>

<p>"You won't be welcome," said my guardian sourly;
and the other man responded with an oath that he
could find his welcome anywhere.</p>

<p>After we had left the table, I saw Jervis Fanshawe
take the other man aside, and begin talking to him in
a low voice, as though impressing something upon
him. But Hockley shook him off, and answered
whatever had been said aloud.</p>

<p>"I tell you I'm going&mdash;and the best thing you can
do is to go with me. If it comes to that, you know
what I am when I get a bit excited; I might need your
restraining hand. You'd better make up your mind
when you'll go, and I'll make my arrangements accordingly."</p>

<p>My guardian said nothing, and the other man threw
himself into a large armchair, and began to smoke. It
was quite late, and I had already begun to think about
going, when he got up, and went off without so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
as a word of farewell to either of us. Only at the door,
with his hat on the back of his head, he came back to
demand an answer to the question he had put at least
an hour before.</p>

<p>"What date will suit you&mdash;next week?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe did not look at him; he was nervously
twisting his hands together behind his back.
"I shall go down on Tuesday to Hammerstone Market,"
he said, "and I shall stay at the house."</p>

<p>"Good. I shall stay at the <i>George</i>." Hockley
lurched out of the doorway, and we heard him slam
the outer door of the house as he went away.</p>

<p>And instantly there came a remarkable change over
my guardian. In all my life I never remember to have
seen a man so suddenly become a wild beast in a
moment as Jervis Fanshawe did then. He ran to
the door, and pulled it open, and spluttered out blasphemies
into the darkness of the staircase; slammed
the door, and came back into the room again, and raged
up and down there, saying horrible things about Hockley
until my blood seemed to run cold. And all the
time taking not the faintest notice of me at all.</p>

<p>Presently he sat down at the table, pulling at his lips
with his long fingers, and still muttering and breathing
hard; it was like the gradual dying away of a storm.
After a time I ventured to speak to him, and to wish
him good-night; I believe I muttered some thanks
for my entertainment. As he took no notice of me,
I went to the door, and found my way to the place
where my hat was; I was going out, when I heard his
voice calling to me sharply. I went back, and found
him waiting there, with a face that was comparatively
calm.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about you artist fellows," he
said, without looking at me&mdash;"but I believe you
sketch&mdash;paint out of doors&mdash;don't you?" As I murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
that we did sometimes do that kind of thing,
he went on hurriedly: "I know a place where you
would probably find some good bits to sketch; you'd
better go down with me. It's the place that fellow
spoke of just now&mdash;Hammerstone Market. I've got
to go down there&mdash;on business; old Patton lives
there."</p>

<p>"Patton?" I asked vaguely; for I seemed to have
seen the name somewhere.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he replied impatiently. "Patton &amp;
Co.: the people for whom I am manager. You were
in their place to-day. He has a country house&mdash;down
there&mdash;and I go down when I like. We'll go on Tuesday;
pack your things; I want you to make a bit of
a splash down there&mdash;play the gentleman. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," I said.</p>

<p>"I want to take the wind out of this fellow's sails&mdash;this
beast Hockley," he said. "I'd grind him to
powder, if I had the chance&mdash;crush him to nothing.
You and I will play our own game, Charlie"&mdash;(it was
the first time he had called me by that name, and I was
a little surprised)&mdash;"and make him put his tail between
his legs. There&mdash;we won't talk any more about
it; good-night!"</p>

<p>I walked home to the rooms Mr. Jervis Fanshawe
had taken for me with my head in a whirl. I know
that I fell asleep that night, with a vague idea that in
some extraordinary fashion my guardian was in the
power of Gavin Hockley, and was obliged, in a sense,
to do what that young man suggested. Perhaps the
mere act of thinking about that drove me into the dream
I presently had; for I remember that I thought presently
I was standing in a room, and that Hockley was
before me, with that grin upon his face; in that dream
I felt that some one put a weapon into my hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Dreams are but intangible things, and this was a confused
one, with only the face of Hockley grinning at me
from out of it, and the knowledge in my own mind that
I held a weapon of some sort gripped in my right hand.
And then the face was gone, and I seemed to wake up,
to see him at my feet, with blood upon him. I woke,
trembling and shuddering, and glad to see the calm
moon staring in at me from the little street outside. It
took me a little time to shake off the horror of the
thing. But I was young, and youth needs sleep; so
that I presently slept until morning.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, that dream haunted me&mdash;sprang
up before me even in the sunlight of the streets, and
would not be shaken off. Seeing that I had no earthly
concern with Hockley, it was at least curious that I
should so persistently think of him; now as I had seen
him swaggering on the steps of the house, and staring
insolently over my head; now as I remembered him
lounging at the table, and apparently overawing my
guardian; and now again, as in my dream, with his
grinning face watching me&mdash;and then lying at my
feet, with blood upon him. I was too young for
such horrors, and yet I could not clear my brain of
them.</p>

<p>That Tuesday arrived on which I was to travel down
to Hammerstone Market with Mr. Jervis Fanshawe.
I had had a note from him the night before, appointing
the time of the train, and requesting me to meet him
at the railway station; and I was eager enough for the
expedition. Although I did not like Fanshawe, and
felt that I never could, there was yet in my heart a
natural feeling of regard for him, as being the one
person intimately connected with me, and, above all,
the man who had looked after my interests during the
years that I had been growing up. I set it down
deliberately here that I wanted to please him, and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
above all things, I was anxious to win his approval.
In a sense I was glad to think that he wanted my company,
although I wondered a little what was going to
happen at this place to which we were going.</p>

<p>In the train he set the matter fairly and clearly before
me. "I am going to this place, Charlie, on a
matter of business," he said in a low tone, and without
looking at me. "Old Patton, as we call him in the
business, likes to make a friend of me as much as
possible; I have been down here frequently. It gives
me a certain position with him&mdash;smooths business
generally. I can't say exactly how long I shall stop
at his house; he does not come up to the office as
frequently as he used to do, and there are certain
matters he wants to discuss with me."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to take me with you," I
said; but with a grim smile he broke in on my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not taking you to the house," he said,
"I shall have to leave you at the <i>George</i>. I intend,
if possible, to get an invitation for you to dinner one
night&mdash;or perhaps to a luncheon; but at the moment
I merely want Patton to know that you are there, and
who you are. He will probably like to know that I am
your guardian, and"&mdash;he hesitated for a moment as
though casting about in his mind for the right word&mdash;"and
responsible for you."</p>

<p>I have since come to think that whatever scheme
was in the mind of the man then, and whatever he
meant to do, his real object in taking me there, to
begin with, was no deeper than that. I think he felt
that it would look well that he should have the responsibility
of me upon his shoulders&mdash;that it would
give him an air of stability, and would cause people
to think well of him&mdash;much as though he held before
himself the record of a good deed as a species of shield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and cried&mdash;"This have I done&mdash;and that; judge
me in the light of it."</p>

<p>So it came about that I was left at the <i>George</i> in the
little town of Hammerstone Market, while Jervis
Fanshawe went on to the house of Mr. Patton, which
lay a little outside the town. The country round
about seemed to be very pretty, and I was free to do
as I liked until such time as my guardian should call
upon me to go back to London, or to visit him at the
house of his patron. I liked the look of the little old-fashioned
hotel, and I liked the prospect of this new
freedom, as I unpacked my bag that first night, in
my room that overlooked the sleepy little High Street
of the town.</p>

<p>Yet that prospect was blurred and made hideous in
the morning by the sudden incursion into it all of that
heavy young man named Gavin Hockley. I had had
my breakfast (and a hearty one at that) in the old low-roofed
coffee-room, and was just making up my mind
to sally forth and do a long day's work, when the door
was thrust open lumberingly and brutally, and Hockley
strode in. Whether or not he knew from my guardian
that I was there it is impossible to say; he looked
over me, or through me, as on the occasion of our first
meeting, and lumbered out again, slamming the door
behind him. Remembering all that I had thought
about him, and remembering my dream, I was too
much upset by his sudden entry into the room even
to be able to speak to him; he was gone before I had
made up my mind what to do.</p>

<p>When I came out into the little hall of the place,
I saw him lounging with one elbow on the low counter
at one side, talking to the girl who stood among the
bottles and glasses behind it; and one heavy hand
was on his hip, and in that hand was his stick, just as
it had been when he stood on the steps and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
down at me. The little place seemed full of him&mdash;poisoned
by him; I was glad to get out into the sweet
air of the little town, and further than that into the
woods and the fields.</p>

<p>I like to think of that morning now: I have seen
myself, in imagination, going so often down a long,
dusty road, with my easel and colour box slung across
my shoulders; I believe I sang softly to myself as I
went. For the spring was in my heart and in my blood,
and life was very, very beautiful. I see myself leaving
the road behind me, and turning into a little wood near
at hand, and sitting down to sketch the glories that
stretched before me. But I was like a butterfly that
morning, in that all was so beautiful that nothing
wholly pleased me; I went deeper on into the wood,
and started again to paint. And lost myself in my
work and in a waking dream, until I was aroused by
the sound of a young girl singing.</p>

<p>(I lay down my pen here for a moment or two, because
my eyes are dim, and I cannot go on. The
sunlight and the trees and all the mystery and the
beauty of the woods are with me again, and the dear
voice of the woman I was to love through all my life
floats to me again, and stirs something within my sad
heart that was stirred that morning, never to be still
again. I close my eyes for a moment, and cover them
with my hands; and I am back there once more,
looking at her wonderingly as she comes towards me
through the trees.)</p>

<p>I will not try to describe her; I only know that she
was very, very fair, and that she seemed almost a
spirit of beauty, coming out of the wood towards me.
She was Nature&mdash;and Love&mdash;and Life&mdash;and Laughter&mdash;all
embodied; I could only sit and watch her; it
did not occur to me even to ask myself who she was.</p>

<p>She did not see me until she was quite close, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
then she stopped, and looked at me, quite unafraid.
She was quite young&mdash;only eighteen, as I knew afterwards&mdash;and
she looked little more than a child. As I
stumbled to my feet, she looked shyly at me, and
smiled; and it seemed then as though I knew her, and
as though she knew me. Afterwards, when we came
at another time to talk about it, she told me that it
had seemed as though she had come there to meet me
out of some other life that was left behind with that
moment; and indeed, I cannot better express my own
feelings than in that way. Perhaps Youth called to
Youth; or perhaps all that was to be was written
down in some grim Book of Fate, of which we did not
hold the key.</p>

<p>She shyly looked at my work, and asked questions
about it; begged that I would go on with it&mdash;and
perhaps wondered why I could not, with her distracting
draperies fluttering against me almost, as she stood.
Like a child, and with a child's confidence in me, she
offered to show me a spot in the woods more beautiful
than that I had chosen; I left my easel, and we walked
side by side among the trees, talking. I do not know
now of what we talked, but we seemed to speak of
everything vital and important in heaven and earth.
And then, surprisingly, she told me her name.</p>

<p>"I am Barbara Patton. I ought to have told
you."</p>

<p>"Patton?" I said, remembering my guardian's
mention of that name, and of the house at which he
was living.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mr. Patton, up at the house there, is my
father. And you?"</p>

<p>I gave her my name, and we laughed a little consciously
at the thought that now we should know each
other perfectly, and that all was fair and straight between
us. I have never met any one like her&mdash;never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
any one so wonderful; I have known but few women,
but I am sure there never was any one like her in the
world. She woke in me then, apart from the love I
knew had come into my heart at the mere sight of her,
a desire to protect her; and to be chivalrous and manly
and strong, for her sake, to every creature in the
world.</p>

<p>I told her about my guardian; and when I spoke of
him I thought I saw the girlish face change a little,
and a look of anxiety come into the sunny eyes. A
little reserve came over her, too, so that she spoke less
freely of herself; I wondered if she disliked him as
much as I did. Strangely enough, she voiced that
feeling in a moment, when she faced round upon me
and asked the question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you like him?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," I faltered. "I've only known
him a matter of hours." Then, daringly willing to
meet her mood in the matter, I added quickly: "Of
course, if you don't like him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of him," she said, looking quickly about
her among the trees. Then, speaking more naturally,
she said: "I hope I shall see something of you, Mr
Avaline, before you go back to London. I'm sure
that my father would be glad."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to me, as though in farewell,
and as though desiring that some distance should be
set between us after our easy familiarity. I took her
hand, and held it for a moment, and looked into her
eyes; and in that second of time something seemed
to pass from the one to the other of us, and back
again, that needed no words. It was as though each
expressed dumbly to the other mute confidence in the
other, and in what was in the other's heart.</p>

<p>I stumbled over the words I said to her. "I'm so
glad&mdash;glad I've met you, Miss Patton," I said; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
my heart sang "Barbara!" over and over again as
I said it.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to have met you, Mr. Avaline," she
replied. And then, after shyly leaving her hand in
mind for a moment, she withdrew it, and laughed,
and turned away.</p>

<p>I watched her as she moved away through the
trees, until at last she turned, and glanced back at
me; and then we both turned away abruptly, and
hurried out of sight. I went so fast that I stumbled,
within a matter of yards, over a man lying flat on his
back, smoking, and staring up at the tree-tops;
I had kicked against him before I saw that it was
Hockley.</p>

<p>"Why the devil don't you look where you're
going!" he growled, in response to my apology.</p>

<p>I thought nothing of it then, although I have remembered
it bitterly enough since. I thought only of
her I had left&mdash;wondered why the world was changed
in a moment for me, so that no loutish young men who
sprawled in the sunlight could poison the woods for
me, or spoil the prospect. And yet it seemed that that
wood was haunted that day; for, as I hurried off to
find my easel, I saw another man standing at the edge
of a little pool, staring down into the water over his
folded arms. He was so intent upon the water, or
seemed to be, that he did not notice me; it was my
guardian, Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>I did not speak to him; I hurried on to where I had
left my easel. Coming to it, I saw that the canvas
had been overturned, and that a muddy heel had been
ground into the painting, leaving it broken and ruined.
I seemed to know instinctively who had done that;
I hurried back through the wood in search of Hockley.
But though I looked in all directions, and even called
his name sternly, I saw nothing of him; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
end I did not trouble further about it, but went home,
hugging my new happiness in my heart.</p>

<p>There I found a note from my guardian, curtly bidding
me come up to the house that night, to dine with
Mr. Patton.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<a name="AND_WHAT_I_LOST" id="AND_WHAT_I_LOST">AND WHAT I LOST</a></h3>


<p>I lunched alone that day, and spent the afternoon
in the woods&mdash;perhaps with a vague hope
that I might again see Barbara Patton, as I had seen
her that morning. But I saw no one; even Hockley
kept out of my way, perhaps for obvious reasons.
I comforted myself with the reflection that I was to
see her that night; I began to count the hours that
must pass before I should meet her.</p>

<p>I got back to the inn, and began to dress, long before
it was necessary that I should do so at all; I was
like a girl in my desire to look well that night, and to
create a good impression. Not that I had any definite
feeling as to what was to happen in the future;
it had not gone far enough for that. I was in love,
and that was all I thought about; and I was going
to meet her again, and to touch her hand and look into
her eyes. I lived in an impossible world, and dreamed
impossible dreams.</p>

<p>While I dressed in a perfunctory fashion, I happened
to glance out of the window, and saw Jervis
Fanshawe coming straight along the road towards
the inn. I was a little surprised, and for one moment
a horrible fear assailed me that he had come to tell
me that the dinner had been postponed; the next,
I stopped in what I was doing, to watch him as he
walked, and to wonder at his hurry. For he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
coming along at a sort of half trot, with his eyes bent
on the ground, and his hands clasped before him;
I could see the white fingers working together convulsively
as he came.</p>

<p>He came into my room, and stood for a moment
or two looking at me, as though scarcely knowing
what to say, or how to account for his presence. I
expressed my surprise at seeing him, and asked if
anything was the matter.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing is the matter," he replied, in a low
tone. "You're early with your dressing," he added.</p>

<p>I muttered some excuse, and went on fastening my
collar. He seated himself on the bed, so that he
was directly behind me, and I could not see him. An
obstinate stud happening to fall, I stooped to pick
it up, and in so doing moved a little to one side; as
I straightened myself again, I caught sight of his face
in the looking-glass. In that momentary glimpse I
had of it, I saw, to my astonishment, that it was convulsed
with rage&mdash;livid with a hatred so deadly that
instinctively I swung round to look at the man. But
by that time the face was calm and composed, and
he was speaking in an ordinary voice. The change
had been so sudden and so complete that I had a
dazed feeling that I must have been mistaken, and
had never seen that look at all.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you, Charlie, before you went to
the house to-night," he began, pressing his palms
closely together, and sawing his hands backwards
and forwards with a regular movement between his
knees as he sat. "You're going to a strange house
to-night, and it's just as well, perhaps, that you should
know something about the people you will meet.
You're young yet, and have not had much experience."</p>

<p>I laughed to myself to think how little he knew
that I had seen the most important person in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
house that very day; mine was the wisdom of youth,
and I was sorry for this man, so much older than
myself, who did not understand these matters.</p>

<p>"Old Patton has every confidence in me&mdash;trusts
me completely. In fact, I may say that he has a
liking for me that he has for very few men."</p>

<p>I wondered a little what manner of man old Patton
could be that he should like my guardian, but I said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Mr. Patton has a daughter&mdash;a very presentable
sort of girl, and, of course, a lady," went on Fanshawe;
and for some unaccountable reason I found my fingers
fumbling and trembling over the tying of my white
tie. "Save for him, she is alone in the world, and
must, of course, be provided for. Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>I followed him so well that the tie I was fumbling
at had become a mere piece of crumpled rag; I tore
it from my neck, and took another.</p>

<p>"So that I have decided to marry the girl, and in
that way consolidate my position&mdash;and hers. It is,
of course, not public in any way yet, and I do not wish
you to say anything about it." He paused, and in
the silence of the room I could hear his hands rubbing
together over each other. "Well&mdash;why don't you
speak?" he demanded at last.</p>

<p>I could not trust myself to look round; I spoke
with my back to him. "And what about the young
lady?" I managed to ask. "What does she say?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he responded blankly.
"She hasn't said anything yet; she hasn't been
asked. It isn't exactly a question for her."</p>

<p>I threw up my head, and I laughed loud and long.
The thing was so absurd, from my point of view, and
I was so sure of her, that I almost seemed to see Jervis
Fanshawe standing before her, and asking his question;
seemed to hear her laugh with me at the absurdity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of it. What did this man know of love or a girlish
heart?</p>

<p>He got up abruptly, and came and stood beside me;
as I still laughed, he rapped sharply with his knuckles
on the dressing-table, as though to call me to order.
In that moment reserve was thrown aside, and the
man blurted out what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in the wood to-day with
her?" he asked, with his face so close to mine that I
could feel his hot breath on my cheek. I faced round
at him squarely.</p>

<p>"Why were you spying on me?" I demanded
hotly; and at the look in his eyes I shrank back from
him, a little afraid. For I had never seen on any face
such a look of mingled fear and hopelessness, and
longing and misery, as I saw in his face then.</p>

<p>"Why was I spying on you? Why do I spy on
every one? Why do I feel, when I am near that child,
like a weak and impotent child myself? I could
crush the life out of her with that hand"&mdash;he shook
it fiercely in the air before me as he spoke&mdash;"and yet
she could make me do murder, with a word or a look.
I want her&mdash;and I mean to have her; there's a passion
in me that a boy such as you can't understand. Besides,"
he went on more calmly, "there are other
reasons&mdash;reasons you know nothing about. I've gone
too far to draw back&mdash;and yet I'm afraid to go on.
Charlie"&mdash;he laid his hand on my arm, and I felt it
shake&mdash;"you've got to help me somehow; we've got
to get through this thing together. Unless I marry
this girl&mdash;(and God knows I'd treat her well)&mdash;it
means red ruin for me&mdash;and perhaps worse."</p>

<p>"She doesn't love you," I said coldly, urging the
only argument I knew.</p>

<p>"I don't ask for that," he retorted bluntly, "because
I don't understand it. I'm going to marry her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
I think my influence is strong enough with her father
for that; I am necessary to him."</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about," I
told him. "Do you think she'd turn to you, or have
a word to say to you, if you tried to draw her with
any other power save that of love? Women don't
marry in that way," I added, with the deep wisdom
that had come to me that day.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think she's in love with you?"
he sneered.</p>

<p>I felt myself burning red all over the face I turned
from him, yet I answered steadily. "I should like
to think so," I replied; and in spite of his jeers I
refused to say any more then.</p>

<p>He paced about the room for a time, stepping carefully
over the pattern in the carpet, as though deep in
thought. Presently he stopped almost behind me,
and spoke in a tone that was half pleading and half
threatening. "You mustn't be a fool over this matter,
Charlie," he said. "Yours is calf love; you're not
old enough to know anything about that sort of thing
yet. Besides, old Patton would laugh at you."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to marry old Patton," I reminded
him. "In any case, I don't want to discuss the
matter, because there's nothing to discuss. Only for
your own sake I would advise you to think twice before
you suggest marrying Barbara Patton."</p>

<p>"How did you come to know her name?" he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"From her own lips," I replied, turning away from
him, and beginning to finish my dressing.</p>

<p>I remember that before he hurried away he strove
to patch up some sort of peace with me; held out
his hand, with seeming frankness, and declared that I
was a fine fellow, and that he meant to stand by me.
What he meant by that I did not exactly know; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
only understood that he was nervous and anxious,
and although I chafed at the thought of his daring to
raise eyes to my Barbara, I yet felt a sort of sneaking
pity for him, as some one lower than myself, who did
not understand this business of love, and had no real
chance in the game.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I was troubled. I did not like the
thought that this girl, who had suddenly become, in a
matter of hours, so much to me, should be the centre
of plots and intrigues; above all, I did not like to
think that there might be a possibility that my guardian
would be able to use a powerful lever to gain her
father on his own side. I thought of her always among
the trees in the sunlight&mdash;and alone with me; I could
not bear to think of her then in any other way. Even
while I longed for the moment to arrive when I should
see her, I yet felt that insane jealousy of youth which
resented the thought that others would be about
her, and would claim her attention.</p>

<p>I walked in the gathering dusk to the house, being
nearly run down in consequence by a dogcart, in
which was seated a man whom I felt instinctively must
be Gavin Hockley. I do not know why I thought so,
except for his brutal method of driving, and for the
fact that he shouted at me for daring to be on the
same road with him. I wondered a little where he
was going; I understood better when, on reaching
the house, I saw him lounging with his hands in his
pockets in the doorway of the drawing-room. I
thought of my ruined painting, and of my escape from
an accident but a few minutes before; but I said
nothing. I could not quarrel with the fellow there,
but I made up my mind that I would have something
to say to him before we parted for the night.</p>

<p>The house was an old and roomy one&mdash;just the sort
of country house that one would expect a substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
man of business to have. There were several guests
besides myself: one elderly lady, whom I understood
to be a sister to old Patton; a doctor from the
neighbourhood and his wife; and a tall pleasant-faced
young man, not very intelligent-looking, but
with good-humour writ large all over him. For some
reason our host was not there when we arrived, but
he came in almost immediately afterwards, with
Barbara on his arm, and closely followed by Jervis
Fanshawe.</p>

<p>I cannot account for it even now, save by the suggestion
that I was myself fully on the alert that night,
and expectant of anything and everything that might
happen; but the very air was stormy. The mere
mutterings of that storm came, as it were, into the
room with old Patton and his daughter; the menace
of it was in the white watchful face of my guardian
behind them. And yet there was nothing in the
least stormy in the appearance of old Patton himself;
indeed, he was quite a benevolent-looking gentleman,
rather too old, I thought, to be the father of Barbara,
for his hair was white, and he stooped a little as he
walked. But he had a kindly face, with yet a certain
strong note of determination in it.</p>

<p>Barbara raised her eyes to mine once, and once
only; and in that flash I strove to read her thoughts
and her heart. In the look I thought I detected that
she mutely asked me something, or pleaded with me;
so much I seemed to understand, but no more. She
gave no sign of knowing me, and only bowed slightly
when I was introduced; old Patton, on the other
hand, greeted me warmly, and had a cordial word or
two to say about my guardian. He shook hands,
too, with Hockley, and seemed to know him; I
gathered that Hockley had been there before.</p>

<p>I had had a wild dream that I might take Barbara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in to dinner; but that was reserved for the young
man of the good-humoured face. Somehow I felt I
did not like him quite so well as I had at first, but,
remembering our meeting in the wood, I felt that
Barbara probably shared my feelings on the matter,
and suffered as much as I did. I went in at the tail
end of the little procession, and was consoled to find
that Barbara was seated opposite me, and that I
could watch her easily during the progress of the meal.
Other eyes were watching her, too, with a curious
intentness; my guardian's, with his nostrils distended,
and his hands nervously gripping each other; Hockley's,
with the brutal dull look that belonged to him.
For her own part, she kept her eyes on her plate, and
only now and then seemed to answer a remark addressed
to her by the young man of the good-humoured
face, whose name I heard was Lucas Savell.</p>

<p>I do not remember the dinner; it seemed all Barbara.
I know I replied to words addressed to me, and I
suppose I replied fairly intelligently; but all the time
I seemed to see that face before me, and to see it,
strangely enough, as the centre of that storm-cloud
that was gathering. From that face I would glance
for a moment to the face of Jervis Fanshawe, that
never seemed to change, and that was like a white
mask; and from that again to the face of old Patton,
at the head of the table, watching the bent head of
his daughter; or again to Hockley, lounging clumsily
in his chair, with his shoulder turned towards the
doctor's wife, the while he carelessly flung a remark or
two over it at that lady. And so back to Barbara again.</p>

<p>I awoke to the consciousness that the doctor was
telling a story, and telling it, as it seemed, rather well,
to judge by the interested faces about him; even
Barbara had raised her head a little, and seemed to
be listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"It came to this, therefore," the doctor was saying,
"that this man had a reason for getting rid of
two people, and, so far as I can make out (for, of
course, you will understand that I cannot give names
or dates or places), set about deliberately to compass
the death of both. The one man he determined
should, if possible, be induced to kill the other, and
in so doing should, of necessity, kill himself, in suffering
the just penalty of his crime."</p>

<p>"And did the plan succeed?" It was old Patton
who asked the question, and it was obvious that he
asked it more to keep the conversation alive than for
any real interest he felt in such a subject.</p>

<p>"Yes, the plan succeeded," said the doctor, softly
crumbling a morsel of bread, and looking down at it,
before raising his bright eyes for a moment to his host.
"He brought the two men together, as if in the most
innocent way; saw to it that they were thrown
much into each other's company; arranged that they
should become on such intimate terms that they should
know each other's secret lives, and so should play
into each other's hands, and into his. And in that
way he almost overshot the mark; for they became
so friendly that there seemed for a time but little
prospect that the one should ever quarrel with the
other sufficiently to seek his life. Therefore our friend
determined to introduce another element&mdash;a mere
pawn in the game. He chose a woman."</p>

<p>A little sigh went up from the company, and there
was some small nodding of heads, as though this was
quite what might have been expected. Glancing
round the table, I caught sight of only one face, and
that a horrible one; the face of Jervis Fanshawe,
thrust forward, with eager eyes fixed on those of the
doctor. It fascinated me, and I watched it.</p>

<p>"He saw to it that the woman was young, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
attractive, and virtuous; he rightly calculated that,
if carefully managed, it might happen that the younger
man would fall in love with her. And sure enough
that was exactly what did happen; the younger man,
although quite hopelessly, worshipped her in a romantic
and very ideal sort of way."</p>

<p>"I begin to understand," said Lucas Savell, nodding
his head. "The other man fell in love with her, too."
"Nothing so commonplace," replied the doctor.
"Our friend who had the scheme in mind went to
that other man, and whispered lies about the woman&mdash;dropping
a sure poison where he knew it would take
root and spread. And presently it happened that
the elder of the two men who were destined to die
breathed a word against the woman the other loved,
and another word, and yet another; the breach
grew and grew, and the man who had repeated the
lie strove hard to justify what he had said. Then
came the final business of all, when the younger man,
in a fit of rage, struck down his friend, and in due
course paid the penalty with his life."</p>

<p>Another little sigh, almost of relief, as the story
finished; then, after a pause, conversation broke out
more generally. Looking up, I caught the eye of my
guardian, and saw that he was watching me; he smiled,
as a man does who catches the eye of a friend, and
then looked away. And then in a moment, as it
seemed, that storm that had hovered over us burst
suddenly and relentlessly.</p>

<p>Old Patton made a sign to a servant, and whispered
something to the man, who bent his head to listen;
then the man and another hurried round, and began
to fill the champagne glasses. I saw that Barbara
was watching her father; I saw her lips parted, as
though she would have spoken, but dared not. And
still I did not understand; still it never occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
me to look at the young man of the good-humoured
face, who sat beside her, and who had, I imagine,
begun to colour a little consciously.</p>

<p>"And now for something a little more pleasant,"
said old Patton, with the somewhat dictatorial air of
the host. "Your glasses are charged, friends, and
I have a toast to propose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now, father," I heard Barbara's distressed
voice say.</p>

<p>"A toast you will all be glad, I am sure, to drink
heartily. I give you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Father!&mdash;not now!"</p>

<p>"My dear child, better now than at any time,"
he retorted, nodding at her with a kindly frown. "My
friends," he went on, looking round at us&mdash;"I have
an announcement to make to you&mdash;an announcement
of a very pleasing character." He cleared his throat,
and jerked his chin up a little, with an air of importance.
"I have to announce the engagement of my
daughter Barbara to her cousin&mdash;Lucas Savell&mdash;and
I ask you to drink their healths."</p>

<p>I know that my heart seemed to stand still; in the
momentary silence I could only stare straight across
at the girl. She had raised her eyes, and was looking
straight at me; and again in those eyes I read
pleading and entreaty, and perhaps a prayer that I
would understand. Our eyes held each other's then,
just as they had held by their glances in the
wood.</p>

<p>"I am getting on in years, and it is more than possible
that there is not much more time left to me," went
on old Patton. "I shall be glad to feel that my child's
future is safe in the hands of a good man. It has been
the wish of my life that these two young people should
marry, and after a little hesitation&mdash;coyness, I suppose&mdash;the
thing has been settled. My friends"&mdash;he raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
his glass, and smiled round upon us all&mdash;"the health
of my daughter and of her future husband!"</p>

<p>We all stood up, raising our glasses, and murmuring
the toast. Some little surprise and confusion was
caused by the fact that the thin stem of my glass
snapped in my fingers, so that the glass fell, spilling
the wine over the cloth. It did not seem to matter
then; nothing seemed to matter at all; the world
was dead for me. I was glad when presently the ladies
rose to go; I saw Savell whisper something to Barbara,
and saw that she replied, without looking at him. Nor
did she look at me again; she passed out of the room
with bent head.</p>

<p>I heard a whisper at my ear. "Well, what's your
opinion of women now?" I turned, and saw the
leering face of Gavin Hockley, with the corners of his
mouth drawn down in a sneer. I did not reply to
him; I lit a cigarette that was offered me, and wondered
how long I must wait before I could get away.
I meant to walk the night away, and get rid of my
sorrow.</p>

<p>We went soon into the drawing-room, for Barbara
was singing, and her father wished us to hear it. Looking
back on that night now, I have wondered often
and often what I must have seemed like to the other
guests&mdash;have wondered whether by chance any one
guessed my secret, or knew the bitter ache in my heart.
It was one evening in my life that was full of acutest
misery; yet I was to be compensated, strangely
enough, and hopelessly enough.</p>

<p>She had been singing, while her lover stood beside
her at the piano. The room seemed suffocating, and
I got up, and stood by an open French window, looking
out over the dark garden; I felt somehow as though
my heart, beating up madly into my throat, must
burst. The music behind me ceased, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was a movement in the room; I did not turn my
head.</p>

<p>I heard rather than saw the movement of her dress
near to me; caught the quick whisper that was as a
mere breath of sound, as she stepped over the sill of
the French window, and went past me into the darkness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must speak to you."</p>

<p>I was stepping out straight after her, when I was
thrust aside in a fashion that drove me hard against
the window-frame, and Hockley strode out after her.
I had recovered myself, and was beside him in a
moment; but not before he had caught her hand,
and drawn it under his arm roughly.</p>

<p>"Your future husband will have enough of you in
the future, my dear," he said, a little thickly. "Come
out into the garden."</p>

<p>Behind me in the room I could hear the soft well-bred
laughter; before me in the darkness that little
tragedy was going on. For the girl was pulling
helplessly at his arm to get away; I heard her pleading
with him in a whisper. The sight maddened me; I
was not responsible for what I did. I spoke to him
sharply; and as he swung round, and she strove again
to free herself, I struck him with all my might&mdash;flinging
all the rage and despair that was in my heart into
the blow&mdash;fair on the temple. He threw up his arm,
and went down backwards over some steps that led
from the terrace. I felt certain that I had killed him.</p>

<p>The noise he made, and a shout he gave as he went
down, had alarmed the people in the room; they
came crowding out to see what was wrong. Their
excited faces were behind us; up from the darkness
rose the surprised face of Gavin Hockley; I saw him
furtively brushing the dust from his clothes, as he
rose first to his knees, and then to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing to make a fuss about," he growled. "I&mdash;I
slipped. Infernally dark out here."</p>

<p>I caught a look on the face of my guardian that
puzzled me; it was that eager look again, but intensified
a thousandfold; and he was smiling straight at
me as though&mdash;ridiculous thought!&mdash;I had done some
worthy thing in his eyes. That look surprised me,
and in a vague way terrified me.</p>

<p>As the confusion subsided, and the people went back
into the room, I found that the girl was clinging to my
arm; and it seemed natural that she should do so.
Hockley had slouched away, muttering that he
would put himself straight; once again it happened
that Barbara and I were alone together. We passed
out of sight of the windows; and then in a moment,
at the end of the terrace, we stood in perfect understanding,
as it seemed, with hands clasping hands, and my
boyish eyes looking into her girlish ones. And it was
writ in the skies above us, and whispered by the trees
forlornly enough, that we loved each other, and that
it was all hopeless.</p>

<p>"I promised a year ago&mdash;before I understood," she
whispered, as though taking up a tale that had been
told between us. "My father likes him; he will be
good to me, I know. I&mdash;I did not understand."</p>

<p>I seemed to live twenty lives in that moment when
I stood and held her hands, and listened to her words.
There was a savage pride in my heart, greater than
my misery, that I should so have won her without a
word; I knew that I was greater in her sight than the
man whose name she was to take. Boy though I
was, I know that I dedicated myself and my life to her
then; the world has never seemed to me so pure and
holy since as it did then. I was not ashamed of the
tears I shed, as I bent my head, and put my lips to
her hands; I felt that I could not shame her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
any pleadings or protestations. When presently we
were calmer, I walked slowly back into the world with
her, and gave her to the man to whom she belonged,
and who had come in search of her.</p>

<p>I did not see her again that night; she pleaded
fatigue, and went to her room. The little party broke
up, and I presently found myself on the high road
under the stars, walking beside Jervis Fanshawe. And
the thing that surprised me most was the extraordinary
mood the man was in. He gave vent to little soft
chuckles from time to time, and snapped his long fingers,
and muttered to himself; while every now and then
he dropped a hand on my shoulder, and gave it an
approving squeeze, as though in pure friendliness.
It was only when he spoke to me that my mind went
back to my encounter with Hockley that night.</p>

<p>"You struck well, my boy; I'd like to have seen
the whole thing, but I was a bit too late. Muscle is a
magnificent possession; and you must be very strong."
He slipped his hand down my arm as he spoke, and
chuckled again. "Always strike hard, Charlie; stand
no insolence from a creature like that. He's a leper&mdash;a
bullying beast&mdash;a robber!" Strong though I was,
he absolutely hurt me with the grip he gave my
arm.</p>

<p>"He's walking along just in front of us," I said a
moment later, as we saw a figure slouching along ahead.</p>

<p>Hockley turned as we got near to him, and waited
for us. I braced myself for a possible encounter; I
think in that moment I rather longed for it. But the
man contented himself with coming towards us, with
his hands thrust in his pockets; and so stopping in
the road in the darkness to look me over.</p>

<p>"I make it a rule to let a man have blow for blow,"
he said, slowly and doggedly, "but I also make it a
rule to get my blow in at my own time of day. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
out for yourself, you young dog; you'll get it when
you least expect it."</p>

<p>I said nothing, and he slouched on again for a yard
or two, turned again, and came back. And this time
he approached my guardian.</p>

<p>"As for you, Jervis Fanshawe, I've a bone to pick
with you. You're responsible for this cub, and you've
no right to let him loose about the country, interfering
with honest men."</p>

<p>"Honest men, indeed!" sneered Fanshawe, getting
a little behind me as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;honest men," repeated the other. "I hope
it doesn't touch you on the raw, Fanshawe," he added,
with a grin. "And mark what I say: I'll have a
kick at you for this night's work, and I'll begin now.
I want my money within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"You know you can't have it," replied my guardian,
in a voice that had suddenly changed.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;then I'll talk!" exclaimed Gavin
Hockley, swinging round on his heel with a laugh, and
striding off into the darkness.</p>

<p>I felt my arm gripped again; I looked round into a
white distorted face that shocked and frightened me.
If ever I saw murder in a man's eyes I saw it then.</p>

<p>"When next you strike him, Charlie&mdash;strike him
hard," he whispered passionately in my ear. "When
next you strike him&mdash;strike him dead!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

<a name="HER_WEDDING_DAY" id="HER_WEDDING_DAY">HER WEDDING DAY</a></h3>


<p>I went to London the next morning, something
to the astonishment of my guardian, who protested
feebly that there was nothing to take me away,
and suggested that he needed my presence in the
country. But I felt that my life, so far as Hammerstone
Market was concerned, was closed; I did not
ever wish to see the place again.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought for a moment, on account of
my youth, that this was a mere boyish infatuation,
out of which I should in time naturally have grown,
remembering it at the best as only a tender boyish
romance. It was never that; it had set its roots too
deeply in the very fibres of my soul ever to be rooted
up. I have heard that there are men like that, to whom
love, coming early, comes cruelly&mdash;bending and twisting
and torturing them, and creeping into their hearts,
to cling there for ever. Such a case was mine; I have
never been able to shake off that first impression, nor
to forget all that her eyes seemed to say to me, on the
terrace under the stars, when I kissed her hands, and
bade her that mute farewell.</p>

<p>So I came to London, and went to my rooms, and
set myself to work. I had fully made up my mind that
this should not change my life; I had a purpose in
view, in that I felt it was vitally necessary I should
justify myself in her eyes, and justify her love for me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
If I had sunk then in my own estimation, or had fallen
away from the high ideals I had set up, so I felt must I
have sunk before her, and fallen away from her. She
was never to be anything to me, but she should feel that
I had at least been worthy.</p>

<p>It must have been about a week after my return to
London when my guardian came to me. My rooms
were in a narrow street off Holborn, at the very top of a
house; the chief room had a great skylight stretching
over nearly half of it, making it a very excellent studio.
I was at work there, getting the last of the light of the
dying day, when he came in, and stood for a moment
watching me, before I laid down my palette and went
to greet him. I thought he looked thinner and more
haggard even than before, and I thought that that
nervous eager intensity in his face had increased. He
just touched my hand with his, and then stood for a
minute or so looking at the canvas. But when he
spoke it was not of the picture.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Hockley?" he asked
abruptly, without looking at me.</p>

<p>"No; what should I see of him?" I asked in reply.
"I have seen no one."</p>

<p>He gave a grim chuckle, and bent forward to look
at the canvas more closely. Yet still he did not speak
of the picture.</p>

<p>"He's left Hammerstone Market," he went on.
"Made it a bit too hot to hold him, I fancy. And
he's been saying mad things about me&mdash;and about you."
He turned his head sharply, and looked at me, and
repeated the words&mdash;"About you."</p>

<p>"It will not trouble me very much, whatever he
says," I retorted.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure; he's a dangerous man," said
my guardian. "He'll talk about any one, and it's all
lies. I shouldn't be surprised"&mdash;he turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
picture again, and examined it&mdash;"I shouldn't be a bit
surprised if he didn't say something more about me one
of these days."</p>

<p>"I remember that I heard him threaten to talk," I
remarked. "But surely a man in your position can
afford to laugh at him and his threats?"</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong," broke in Fanshawe
quickly. "It's the men in my position that can have
lies told about them, lies which they dare not refute.
I tell you he's a dangerous man. More than that, he
has been talking about&mdash;about somebody else."</p>

<p>He walked the length of the room, keeping his back
to me, and examined another of my sketches. I felt
my throat beginning to swell, and knew that the blood
was rising to my face; controlling my voice as well
as I could, I asked a question. "Who is&mdash;who is the
somebody else?"</p>

<p>He turned round, and came towards me, keeping his
hands locked behind him. "About Barbara&mdash;Barbara
Patton," he said. "It seems he saw you that
day in the woods&mdash;the day I was there. And Hockley
is not the man to talk nicely about those things."</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe fell back a step or two as I came
straight up to him; indeed, he unlocked his hands,
and put up one of them as though to guard against a
blow. "What did he say?" I asked; and my voice
sounded unnatural.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I'm not going to tell you;
I'm the last man in the world to make mischief," he
said. "You're a hot-headed boy, and I ought not to
have told you. You'll get nothing more from me."</p>

<p>"Then I'll get it from him," I said, with a little
grim laugh.</p>

<p>"That's your own affair entirely," said my guardian;
and I thought he smiled in a peculiar way as he spoke.</p>

<p>As I strove to master my indignation, and so gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
calmed myself a little, I came to the conclusion
that Fanshawe had something more to say, and was
seeking an opportunity to say it. He pottered about
the studio for a time, stopping every now and then as
if about to speak, and then moving on again; at last he
spoke to me over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"They're hurrying on the wedding a bit; special
licence, and all that kind of thing." Then, as I did
not answer, he turned and asked sharply, "Do you
hear what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear," I responded. "When is it to be?"</p>

<p>"In about a fortnight's time. It's a whim of old
Patton's to get the girl settled, and to know that she
is safe. You'll be asked to go. You'll get a formal
invitation, but I was to tell you from the old man that
you were expected. Only a quiet wedding, of course."</p>

<p>Once again he started that ceaseless rambling round
the studio; once again he stopped. "You don't say
anything about it," he exclaimed querulously. "I
thought you were sweet in that quarter?"</p>

<p>I looked at him quietly; after a moment he dropped
his eyes, and turned away. "You told me once,"
I reminded him, "that you intended to marry Miss
Patton yourself."</p>

<p>"That was a business scheme that came to nothing;
I was forestalled. You were forestalled, too," he added.
"I have not thought any more about it; it was only
a whim."</p>

<p>There was silence between us for a minute or two;
then I remembered something else, and spoke again.
"You said it would mean red ruin to you if you did
not marry her."</p>

<p>"Did I?" He looked at me as though he did not
see me, and as though he were thinking of something
else. "I don't remember it; at any rate, I didn't
mean it in the sense you mean." He hesitated again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and then went on more passionately, with a rising
inflection in his voice that startled me, as it had startled
me once before with this extraordinary man. "On
that day you met her in the woods, when she came to
you, singing and with smiles, and walked and talked
with you&mdash;oh, my God!&mdash;I had spoken to her in the
same place&mdash;before you came at all."</p>

<p>The passion that consumed him was frightful; the
recollection of what he had gone through, and what he
had suppressed, shook and tore him like a storm. He
clenched and unclenched his hands, and moistened
his lips, and strove to speak; fought down that rising
devil in him, and got himself calm again.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she laughed at me." He beat the air before
him, and swallowed hard, and stamped his foot, in a
rage at himself that he could not control himself more
easily. "I did not make&mdash;make love to her; I am
not a boy. I told her that I wanted her, that I wanted
to marry her. And then she&mdash;she laughed."</p>

<p>I could imagine the scene; and yet I think, if she
had known all the deadly things that were to spring
out of her light laughter in the wood that day&mdash;the
lives that were to be shattered, and the souls brought
into the dust&mdash;she might not have done it. She was
but a child, and she did not know the man she had to
deal with; he had meant to humble her, and she had
humbled him too much.</p>

<p>He turned away, choking; although I despised the
man, and although I remembered my own sorrow, I
yet sorrowed for him. When he went on again he had
got himself into some condition of calmness.</p>

<p>"Then I saw you in the woods, and I wondered
that she should meet you as she did, because I knew
you had not met before. It was your cursed youth,"
he broke out, his violence showing again for a moment&mdash;"you
could speak to her with a voice that was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
mine, and that I did not understand. That's all there
is to say; I shall never speak of it again."</p>

<p>I did not know what to say, and so I thought it best
to say nothing. Once more he made the circuit of
the room, and once more he came back to me. Although
I was silent, simply from lack of words, I knew
instinctively that he felt himself to be a meaner thing
than I was, because of his weakness and his rage, and
that he hated me for that knowledge.</p>

<p>"I don't like the thought that you are not friends
with Hockley," he said, as he came back to me, and
laid his hand on my shoulder. "After all, this girl is
going out of our lives, and will be nothing to us in the
future. That bone of contention is gone, and I want
you to meet Hockley. He's got a loose tongue, and
he's not over nice in his manners; but he's not a bad
sort. Say you'll meet him."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not," I said, with a remembrance of
what the man must have said concerning Barbara
and myself.</p>

<p>"You will be doing me a service, if you meet him,
and treat him fairly," said Fanshawe, impressively.
"Come, my dear boy," he pleaded, "I really want you
to help me in a difficult matter. Swallow your pride,
and meet the man."</p>

<p>"How shall I be helping you in that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In a certain way&mdash;to a slight extent, that is&mdash;I am
in his power," said my guardian. "Over a matter of
speculation," he added hurriedly, "a little money I've
lost."</p>

<p>I remembered that demand for money made by
Hockley, and his threat when it was refused; I felt
that I couldn't very well refuse to help the man who
was the only real friend I had in the world. After a
moment of hesitation, I grudgingly said that I would
meet him, if Jervis Fanshawe wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right; that's good of you, Charlie," he
exclaimed, with more fervour than I should have
expected of him. "We'll have a little dinner together,
and you shall see what a good fellow he is, when you
really come to know him. And we'll keep off difficult
topics," he added reassuringly.</p>

<p>On the evening appointed for the dinner I got to
Fanshawe's rooms before Hockley had arrived; and
I found my guardian in a strange humour, even for him.
He made clumsy attempts to be facetious, and to
throw off that rather grave reserved manner he usually
wore; clapped me on the shoulder, and generally
behaved like the really youngish man he was in years.
Before Hockley came in he referred for a moment to
that matter we had discussed in my studio; but he
only touched upon it lightly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think anything, Charlie, of what I
said the other night about&mdash;about a certain subject,"
he said, standing in front of me, and nervously fingering
the lapel of my coat. "I mean about&mdash;about Barbara
Patton. I was never really in earnest, and you and I
have something else to think about in the world beside
girls, haven't we?"</p>

<p>I laughed a little foolishly, but made no direct reply.
He went on with the subject eagerly.</p>

<p>"I've come to the conclusion that I've been taking
life too seriously, Charlie; I've been too grave and
careful. I'll blossom out a bit; we'll both blossom
out." He laughed in an unnatural fashion, and
clapped me on the shoulder again.</p>

<p>"By the way," I said, as a sudden thought occurred
to me, "I've been wanting to talk to you a little about
my affairs&mdash;money matters, you know. I'm getting
hard up, and I don't quite know how I stand in regard to
such things. My income ought to be a substantial
one, but I want to know exactly how much it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>He always had an irritating way of speaking to
any one over his shoulder, with his back to them and
his head half turned; he adopted that method now.
"Why should you trouble about your income?" he
asked, a little sourly. "Don't you trust me?&mdash;don't
you think you're safe in my hands?"</p>

<p>"Of course I trust you," I replied, a little indignantly.
"But I want to know how much I can spend,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Spend as little as possible," he said. "As a matter
of fact, I've tied up your money in various ways, so
that it may be safe; there's not much of it that can be
handled at the moment. You shall have what you
want&mdash;of course, within reason; but you must be
careful&mdash;for your own sake."</p>

<p>I had no suspicion of him then; no doubt of him
entered my mind. I knew nothing of business matters,
and up to that time had always been supplied with the
small sums necessary for my individual expenses, while
all bills had, I believed, been sent to him. Nothing
more was said about the matter then, because the
entrance of Hockley drove everything else from my
mind.</p>

<p>My guardian certainly seemed anxious to do all in
his power to bring Hockley and me to a better understanding.
He insisted on our shaking hands to begin
with; and we performed that ceremony briefly and
distrustfully. He hovered about us, and talked about
our individual tastes, and wondered openly why we
did not meet, or go about together.</p>

<p>"Two men like yourselves, with money and leisure,
you ought to be friends," he asserted. "A poor devil
like myself must be tied to his office chair willy-nilly;
but you both are free. As for you, Hockley, why
don't you take Charlie under your wing, and show him
life and London?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've precious little time to give to other people,"
said Gavin Hockley.</p>

<p>"I have plenty to occupy my days," I said firmly.</p>

<p>Even that rebuff did not discourage my guardian;
he went at us again at the earliest opportunity. He
was quite merry at dinner, as we sat at that round
table of his; and I noticed that he plied Hockley with
wine on every possible occasion. For my own part, I
usually drank but little; but that night I was in a
reckless defiant mood, and I drank all that was given
me. My head was spinning, and I was scarcely master
of myself, when we got up from the table, and went
into Jervis Fanshawe's sitting-room to smoke.</p>

<p>And there, something to my surprise, my guardian
produced cards, and flicked them audaciously before
the face of Hockley. I saw the man's eyes light up, as
he snatched at the pack, and began to shuffle the cards.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd given up playing&mdash;at all events
before the child," I heard him say, in a low tone.</p>

<p>I sprang up from my chair. "Who are you speaking
of?" I demanded hotly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking to you," said Hockley, shuffling
the cards slowly, and looking at me with those dull
eyes of his. "If you chance to overhear what isn't
meant for you to hear, that's not my fault."</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen; I will not have
it!" interposed Fanshawe hurriedly. "A joke's a
joke, and should be taken as such; I won't have you
flying at each other's throats in this fashion. We'll
have a friendly game, and see if it won't mend our
tempers."</p>

<p>I do not know what game we played; I knew only
the simplest games at cards, and this was a complicated
thing of which I knew nothing. My guardian
laughingly assisted me when I got into muddles,
and showed me how to score; but it seemed always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
that Gavin Hockley won. At all events he won from
me, because presently I found, bitterly enough, that
my pockets were empty. I saw the sneer that flitted
across Hockley's face as my guardian thrust some
money into my hand; I could cheerfully have killed
him then.</p>

<p>We played until it was quite late, or rather early in
the morning; and I lost everything. I know at the
last my guardian dropped out of the game, declaring
that he could not go on; but he urged me to have my
revenge, and to see if the luck would turn. But it
would not turn, and Hockley calmly pocketed all I
had. I got up at last, with my head swimming and
my eyes burning; and I faced him shamefacedly
enough.</p>

<p>"You're in my debt, young Avaline," he said, coolly
making a note on a slip of paper. "A small matter of
thirty pounds odd."</p>

<p>I turned to my guardian; but he laughingly shook
his head. "You've cleaned me out, Charlie," he
said; "give our friend an I.O.U., and square up with
him another time."</p>

<p>Humiliated and shamed, and inwardly raging, I
wrote the thing, and tossed it over to Hockley. He
laughed, and folded it up, and put it in his pocket-book.
Even then the brutal mind of the man prompted him
to have a further fling at me.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you didn't win," he said. "You
know the old saying 'Lucky at cards&mdash;&mdash;'&mdash;well, I
won't finish it."</p>

<p>I moved a step nearer to him. "What do you
mean? I don't know any old sayings," I exclaimed,
although I knew it well. "Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"The old saying is"&mdash;he grinned at me, and yet
was watching me warily, I thought&mdash;"'Lucky at
cards, unlucky in love.'" Fanshawe sprang between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
us just as I flew at my man; wound his long arms about
me, and thrust me back by main force. "I tell you
I won't have it," he cried. "As for you, Hockley,
you've got your money; you can hold your tongue."</p>

<p>"The point is that I haven't got my money," said
Hockley. "And I'm not quite sure that I ever shall
get it."</p>

<p>A hot retort sprang to my tongue, but I checked it.
I was in a false position; I could not talk with this
man until I had paid him what I owed. That should
be to-morrow, when my guardian gave me what was
due to me.</p>

<p>But it was to happen that to-morrow was to dawn,
and other to-morrows, and Hockley was not to be paid.
For Jervis Fanshawe put me off with one excuse and
another: now he was too busy to go into the matter
of my accounts; and now he had no ready money;
and now he was engaged at his office, and I could not
see him. In the miserable days that followed he doled
out to me a sovereign or two, sufficient to keep me
going; but I got nothing else. My pride was up in
arms, and I was maddened at the thought that Hockley
had the laugh of me, horrified at the construction he
would put upon my silence. I did not realize then, as
I have realized since, how the thin and subtle net was
closing in upon me, drawn tighter each day by the
man who held the threads of it. I walked blindly
towards a sure and certain goal, and never saw that
goal until it was too late.</p>

<p>I do not now know what took me to Hammerstone
Market for Barbara's wedding. Every instinct within
me, as it seemed, fought against it; I wanted to forget
that I had ever been to the place at all, even while I
jealously hugged the memory of the few precious
minutes I had spent with her. Perhaps it was the
thought that she was going for ever out of my life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
into the life of another man, that drew me down there
for the last time; perhaps it was a sort of despairing
hope that there might yet be a chance that we could
stand together, hand in hand, and cry out the truth
of our love, and defy those who were setting us asunder.
That I knew, in my own mind, was impossible; because
I was bound wholly by her, and knew, as surely
as her eyes had told me, that our cause was hopeless.
But I went down with my guardian; perhaps he had
something to do indirectly with my final decision to go,
because I knew that the fact of my presence there
would for ever silence his tongue.</p>

<p>Barbara's wedding day! I have thought of it since,
over and over again; have watched her, as in a dream,
going down the dim little country church in the sunlight,
with her head bent, while the man of the good-humoured
face waited for her. I have seen them kneel,
side by side, and have heard the solemn words pronounced
over them; I have seen her come out again
on the arm of her husband, pale as death, and with her
head bent always, and her eyes seeking no one. Stay,
I am wrong; for at the last she raised her head, and
looked at me fully, seeming to know, indeed, instinctively
where to find me. And with that look something
in me broke and died; it was as though I had
torn out my heart, and thrown it in the dust at her
feet. She went on into the sunlight with her husband;
and I presently followed mechanically with the others;
hearing about me, as in a dream, the chatter and the
laughter of the gay little crowd.</p>

<p>They were all very merry afterwards; I remember
that there was an old-fashioned wedding breakfast,
and much drinking of toasts, and some speeches. I
know that Lucas Savell made rather a good speech in
a way, and was very properly modest and grateful for
his good fortune; I know, too, that old Patton was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
prosy and long-winded, and that towards the end of
his speech a great many people were chattering together,
and paying no attention to him. Then, after
a time, it all broke up, and she was going.</p>

<p>I remember at the last I saw her coming down a wide
staircase, with her bridesmaids fluttering about her
and laughing; I think she had been crying. I know
her eyes looked piteous, and her lips were quivering;
but perhaps people thought that was quite the proper
thing at a wedding, and with a young bride going away
from home. Then, as she reached the foot of the
stairs, she stopped for a moment to speak specially to
one or two friends; and I was among the number.
She put her hand in mine for a moment, and her lips
formed the words "Good-bye"; but she could not
speak. I stood there still as death; I wonder that
no one noticed me. Then she was gone, and the crowd
had broken up.</p>

<p>I found something in my hand; it was a tiny folded
paper. I remember every word of it now; it was
burnt in upon my brain, never to be effaced so long as
I should live.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Because I love you and trust you, I give you this,
my dear, to read and then to burn. You will do
that because I ask it. You have been very brave and
very gentle with me; you are going always to be very
brave and very gentle, so that I may carry that memory
of you in my heart. I have thought of you in secret,
although I shall do so no more, as my poor Prince
Charlie&mdash;wandering alone, far from his kingdom;
only, unlike the other poor Prince Charlie, you have
no one to comfort you. Good-bye, you are not to
think of me; and yet I pray that you may think of me
a little. You will be my dream-love always.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
<span class="smcap">Barbara.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>I read it over and over until I had got it by heart&mdash;until,
in fact, I knew every turn and twist of the dear
writing; then I burnt it, and destroyed even the ashes.
I was vaguely comforted by it; the thing was not so
bitter as it might have been, because above all else
I held her spirit, and she was mine in that sense, if in
no other. And God knows at that time I had no other
thought of her; I want that understood clearly, so that
it may be understood, too, how little I deserved all
that was to happen to me.</p>

<p>I walked about for a long time, and then I went back
to the hotel; I had made up my mind to stay there
for that night, and then to get to London. I have
wished since, often and often, that I had gone straight
back to that quiet life in town&mdash;that I had never
stopped in that place until perforce I must stay the
night.</p>

<p>My guardian had asked me earlier in the day about
my movements, and I had told him that I intended to
stop at Hammerstone Market. He seemed curious
as to how I was going to spend the evening&mdash;seemed,
indeed, anxious about me; so that I was not altogether
surprised when he presently appeared in my room,
and told me that he had arranged a supper party that
night, and that he wanted me to be present.</p>

<p>"I'd rather stay quietly here, thank you," I told
him brusquely. "I'm in no mood for supper parties
to-night. Leave me alone."</p>

<p>He thrust his thin face close to mine. "You
young fool, do you want everybody to be talking
about you, and about her?" he demanded. "I was
watching you in church to-day, and you looked like
death itself. You don't know what these quiet country
places are; there'll be whispers afloat to-morrow.
Come, my boy&mdash;for her sake."</p>

<p>I looked at him in surprise; I had not expected for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a moment that he would have thought of that aspect
of the case. I began to feel that I had been mistaken
in the man, and that there was really something rather
fine about him. I suppose he saw the effect of his
words, for he shook me rallyingly, and began to drag
me out of the room.</p>

<p>"That's right, come along!" he exclaimed. "Keep
a brave face, and no one can say a word. Come along!"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit!" I urged, drawing back. "Who's
going to be there?"</p>

<p>"Only Hockley beside ourselves," said Fanshawe,
examining his nails. "As a matter of fact, I want
you to meet him again, and if possible get your revenge.
I don't like that money hanging over."</p>

<p>"That's not my fault," I reminded him. "I've
asked you again and again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," he broke in soothingly. "I'll
pay the money, and as much more as you like. This
is going to be a lucky night for us both, Charlie; we're
going to wipe off old scores."</p>

<p>He went down the stairs before me. On the way he
glanced up to see that I was following, and it happened
that the light from a lamp on the staircase fell on his
face. And I remember that I did not like its expression.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<a name="THE_KILLING_OF_THE_LIE" id="THE_KILLING_OF_THE_LIE">THE KILLING OF THE LIE</a></h3>


<p>My story draws near now to that night of my life
when all things for me were to change, and
when I was to go down into the Valley of the Shadow,
and come face to face with Death. I pray you hear
me patiently, and believe that what I write is true of
all that I felt and thought at that time. And God
knows I have had years enough wherein to plan the
writing of it&mdash;years of solitude and misery and exile!</p>

<p>I know that I felt again at that supper party the
same curious premonition of a storm that I had felt
in the house of old Patton. There were dreadful
silences between the three of us&mdash;silences from which
my guardian feverishly awoke us, or that were broken
in upon by some coarse remark from Hockley. For
my part I said little; I seemed to be watching and
waiting; and I know now that I was alert and eager
to snatch at anything the brute might say, and make
much of it. Always I seemed to remember that it
was Barbara's wedding day; and that I stood outside,
like some pale pure knight of old, to guard her
memory, and to be faithful to what she had said to
me. And I knew always that the very atmosphere
of the room and of the men who were with me was
antagonistic to any purity of thought or feeling.
From the very first I would have you understand that,
from that point of view, I was a doomed man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The supper had been carefully ordered and was
excellently served; for such guests the landlord
insisted on waiting in person. Also the wine was
good, and it circulated freely. I seemed to see, each
time that I looked over the glass from which I drank,
the two faces&mdash;that of Hockley, leering and heavy
and brutal; that of my guardian, white and watchful
and eager; and hovering always above us that suggestion
of the storm to come.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the meal, Hockley raised his
glass and stared across at me. "I give you a toast,"
he said, leaning forward over the table&mdash;"I give you
the pretty bride!"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Fanshawe, springing up,
and raising his glass. "The pretty bride!"</p>

<p>"The pretty bride!" I said hoarsely; and drained
my glass, and, boylike, flung it into the fireplace,
where it shivered to pieces. Hockley laughed as he
set his own glass down on the table.</p>

<p>"The one toast&mdash;eh?" he suggested, with a sneer.
"The fair lady would be honoured, I'm sure, if she
knew. But she's nothing to us now, whatever she
may have been."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I demanded,
looking squarely at him.</p>

<p>"Don't take fire so readily," he retorted. "I
mean that she belongs to another man, and I hope
he thinks he's got a prize. Don't glare at me like that,
my young friend," he added with a laugh; "I'd be
the last to say anything against the lady."</p>

<p>"It would be better for you if you said nothing at
all about her," I said; and he lay back in his chair,
and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Come, come; we're getting on dangerous ground,"
broke in my guardian, laying a soothing hand on my
shoulder. "Surely there's no harm in toasting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
lady, as our friend Hockley has done; why should
you be so ready to quarrel with him, Charlie?"</p>

<p>Hockley was still grinning in that unpleasant fashion
of his across the table; I felt bitterly enough that
he looked upon me as a tiresome, quarrelsome boy,
and despised me in consequence. I chafed at the
thought that in all probability I must presently play
cards with him&mdash;perhaps to lose again; I chafed, too,
at the thought that I was dependent on this other
man, my guardian, for money with which to play at
all. And even while I thought that, I had a vision
of Barbara coming down the staircase at her father's
house, with that look in her eyes as though she had
been weeping, and with her lips quivering. Altogether
a bad frame of mind for a boy of twenty to be
in, with two such men for company.</p>

<p>The table was cleared at last, and then the cards
were produced. With a burning face I drew my
guardian aside, and spoke to him earnestly, believing
that he had forgotten my request.</p>

<p>"I have no money," I said, "and I already owe
this man a lot. You promised to let me have some;
you promised to pay Hockley."</p>

<p>"My dear Charlie," he whispered, "do you imagine
that I carry money about with me to that extent, and
especially in a little country place like this? There
are ten chances to one that you will win back to-night
all that you have lost, and more; you won't get two
such runs of bad luck in succession. Play on, and
see how the game goes; I'll back you, whether you
win or lose."</p>

<p>"I won't play to-night," I said doggedly. "I
seem to be getting tangled in a net from which I shall
never extricate myself; I'm getting afraid. I won't
play to-night."</p>

<p>"You young fool!" he exclaimed, in a low voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"do you want to give Hockley another handle to
grasp. Do you want him to say that you owed him
over thirty pounds, and wouldn't pay it, and wouldn't
play again? Can't you understand what manner
of man he is?"</p>

<p>I saw that there was nothing for it but to sit down
with empty pockets, and to trust that my luck would
change. For a time all went well; the cards all came
my way, and I seemed to see the money I had lost
flowing back into my pockets. More than once my
guardian clapped me on the shoulder, and cheered
me on, and rallied Hockley upon his ill-luck; Hockley
set his teeth, and said nothing.</p>

<p>Presently I staked more than I should, and lost;
staked again, and lost again. I saw Hockley's heavy
jaw set firm, as he laid down card after card that
beat mine and my guardian's; he never said a word,
as we played on steadily in a silence which was
growing oppressive. A bell had been rung and an
order given, and some one had put a glass beside
me; I was hot, and my throat was dry, and I
eagerly gulped down what was there. And still the
man before me, in a deadly silence, played his cards,
and made notes on a slip of paper beside him.</p>

<p>I got up from the table at last, overturning my
chair as I did so. Hockley was leaning back, with
the slip of paper held before him, and with a pencil
tapping out the figures on it. My eyes were burning,
and something was singing in my ears; I scarcely
knew where I was.</p>

<p>"Bad luck, Charlie," said the voice of my guardian,
cutting the silence nervously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hockley," I contrived to say, "I never
meant to go on as far as this. I have no money&mdash;at
least, not here; I can only give you my I.O.U.
Will you please tell me how much it is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>He went on deliberately checking the figures; did
not even look at me as he said the amount, yawning
over it a little as he spoke. It was over seventy
pounds; and I seemed to understand that my guardian
owed him something also.</p>

<p>"I can only give you my I.O.U.," I repeated, as I
drew a scrap of paper towards me, and steadied my
hand to write.</p>

<p>"That's no good to me," he said, "not worth the
paper it's written on. I've one already of yours,
and what's it worth?"</p>

<p>"You will be paid," I said, with a helpless look at
my guardian.</p>

<p>"If you play with gentlemen, why don't you pay
like a gentleman," retorted Hockley, snatching at
my scrap of paper, and getting to his feet. "I can't
think what Fanshawe ever meant by bringing you
into a man's business at all; this game isn't for boys."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Hockley!" I cried, making a movement
towards him.</p>

<p>"To the devil with you!" he exclaimed violently.
"I've had enough of your sour looks, and your threats,
and your high-handed ways. Of course we're all
sorry for you; you must be feeling a bit sore to-night,"
he sneered.</p>

<p>I controlled my tongue even then; I remembered the
face of Barbara; I remembered the words of her
note: "I love you and I trust you; you are going
always to be very brave and very gentle, so that I
may carry that memory of you in my heart." No
such bully as this should break down my resolution;
there was a power in me greater than he suspected.</p>

<p>It was my guardian who stirred the wound. "Why
don't you be quiet, Hockley?" he said; "why don't
you leave difficult subjects alone? The past is done
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so's his pretty mistress," exclaimed Hockley.
And it was not so much the words as the fashion in
which he said them that maddened me.</p>

<p>Before Fanshawe could get to me I had overturned
the table, and sprang at my man. He eluded me
with a quickness I should scarcely have given him
credit for, and slipped round behind my guardian;
danced about there, in comparative safety, with
mocking words and looks, keeping Jervis Fanshawe
always between us. The situation was ridiculous,
and I hesitated for very shame.</p>

<p>"Here's a fire-eater!" he cried, emboldened by
the fact that I could not get at him, and that I stood
chafing. "Owes a man money, and gives his dirty
scrap of paper in exchange for it; and then will not
have a word said against the girl who met him in
secret in the wood. Hoighty toity&mdash;we're mighty
particular!"</p>

<p>"I'll quarrel with you on any matter that your
mean soul may choose&mdash;except that," I almost pleaded
with him. "For your own sake as well as mine,
leave her out of the conversation. She's as far above
you as the stars; let your foul tongue wag about something
else."</p>

<p>"My tongue shall wag as it chooses," he retorted,
with a frown. "I know what I know, and I've seen
what I've seen. You thought me asleep in the wood
that day, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Again I saw the face of Barbara&mdash;first as she had
come towards me smiling in the wood, then as she
had come down the stairs, with her eyes on mine&mdash;eyes
that had tears in them. And so I restrained
myself, and waited there, helpless, until he should be
silent.</p>

<p>"A fig for your saints and your Madonnas!" cried
Hockley. "They're the worst of the lot. Our little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
meek-eyed Barbara was a lady of many loves&mdash;in
secret. How did she meet you in the wood&mdash;you
that had never met her before? How did she meet
me&mdash;a dozen times before?"</p>

<p>"For the love of God, keep him quiet!" I cried
to my guardian; for I felt that my head was bursting,
and my throat was dry. I seemed then to be praying
to the only saint I knew for strength and for confidence;
I only wanted to get out of the room, before
I struck the man dead. My guardian did nothing;
he stood still, watching us both; and after a moment
Hockley went on. I had a dim feeling, as he began
to speak again, that people were moving outside the
door; I think the place had been disturbed by the
overturning of the table.</p>

<p>"That makes you wince, doesn't it?" he demanded;
for I think he felt secure, now that other
people were near at hand. "I tell you she was for
any man that cared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I sprang straight at him then, and had him by the
throat. I was young, and my muscles were tough;
more than that, I was in finer condition than he, with
all his drinking and his late nights and his vices, could
hope to be. We went down together, he screaming
out something that sounded like a cry for help; and
I tore and raged at him as though I were mad.</p>

<p>When I came to myself, I was being held by three
or four of them, and he was leaning against the overturned
table, breathing heavily, and trying to arrange
his collar and tie; his face was ghastly. After a
moment he pointed a shaking hand at me, and gasped
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"He tried to murder me; he meant to murder me.
We were&mdash;we were joking, gentlemen&mdash;and he&mdash;he
tried to murder me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I tried to murder you," I said. "And I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
try again, with more success, when I get the chance,
unless you take back what you've said."</p>

<p>"Charlie&mdash;Charlie&mdash;come away!" exclaimed my
guardian, putting his hands on my breast, and pushing
me back. "I'm sorry to have disturbed all you
good people," he added, turning to the landlord, who
was staring at us with a scared face; "but this is only
a matter of hot blood. They'll shake hands in the
morning; they'll be friends again."</p>

<p>They were dragging me away, while I strove to break
from them; I called out again to Hockley. "You
shall take back what you said; I'll make you eat
your lie, or I'll kill you."</p>

<p>I do not think I quite understood what I was saying;
even the shocked scared faces about me could
not make me understand the gravity of it all. I found
myself outside the closed doors of the room, panting
and almost weeping with excitement, with the stout
landlord holding me on one side, and a waiter on the
other. My guardian was speaking&mdash;not to me, but
to the landlord.</p>

<p>"Very well, since you insist, he shall not stop in
the house," said Jervis Fanshawe. "I'll take him
away to Mr. Patton's place; I can secure a bed for
him there. Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I quite understand, and I'm
sorry you've been disturbed; it shall all be put right.
Tell Mr. Hockley that I've gone home."</p>

<p>They got me out of the house; locked the door on
me, in fact. I stood under the stars with Fanshawe,
staring before me down the road, and panting heavily;
for I knew that this was but the beginning. I seemed
to see the foul lips of the man for ever breathing out
lies about her&mdash;lies that must be stopped and killed
now in their birth. That was what I must do, and
quickly. This thing would be spread; I seemed to
see the man whispering it here, there, and everywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with shrugs and leers and winks. Yes, I would kill
it.</p>

<p>As in a sort of dream I heard my guardian talking
to me. "Yes, my dear boy; I know it's abominable&mdash;shameful;
but what can you do? Any one who
knows you and knows her must know that it is all
a lie from beginning to end. There&mdash;there&mdash;come
away. I suppose if we lived in any other century, you
might strike a man down for this; I think I should
strike him down myself, if I were as young and strong
as you are." He was glancing at me curiously as we
stood there in the utter silence of the night; there
seemed a challenge in his eyes. And his suggestion
about any other century had brought back again to
my mind the remembrance that I was her pure knight,
pledged to do battle for her. I began to walk rapidly
away in the direction of the house of the Pattons,
with my guardian walking beside me, and putting in
a word here and there that was meant to be soothing,
and yet that only served to inflame my passion.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have said that about striking him
down, Charlie; that would be murder," he went on.
"And one may not murder another man, however
much one may be tempted, or however richly the man
may deserve death. But the worst of it is, of course,
that one doesn't know how to stop him; he'll go on
saying those things about that sweet girl, and people
will begin to believe&mdash;to say there's no smoke without
fire, and horrible things of that sort. What had
we better do, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"You can leave it to me," I said. "You can safely
leave it to me."</p>

<p>He seemed to be able to do what he liked at the
house of the Pattons. A manservant let us in; my
guardian seemed to whisper something to him to
account for my dishevelled appearance, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
fact that I had no hat. The man got a light in one
of the lower rooms, and presently brought in a
decanter and some glasses; then, at a further whispered
suggestion from Fanshawe, retired and left us
alone together. My guardian was hovering about
me anxiously&mdash;now murmuring what a shame it was
that such things should be said openly about such a
girl as Barbara&mdash;now muttering what he would do if
he were a younger man&mdash;now urging me feebly to
forget all about it, and leave the man alone.</p>

<p>"Above all, Charlie&mdash;no violence," he said. "I
shudder to think what you might have done if I had
not prevented you to-night. You won't mend things
that way; we must think of some other method."</p>

<p>I said nothing; I drank mechanically what he put
into my hand; I acquiesced in his suggestion that
I should go to bed. My last recollection of him was
when he came into my room, looking thinner and more
gaunt than ever in a dark dressing gown, and hovered
over me with a candle, and hoped that I would sleep.</p>

<p>But sleep was not for me that night; I had other
things to think about. The lie faced me, like a grey
haunting shadow, in the night; had become more
horrible with the first streaks of dawn. The more I
strove to control myself&mdash;the more I told myself that
what such a creature as Hockley might say could not
matter&mdash;the more my passion grew. And it was a
worse passion now, because there was growing up in
it a method that was greater than the madness of the
night before. In that long night, wherein I lay and
thought the thing over, the boyish part of me seemed
to have lived far back in another age; it was a new
Charles Avaline that rose with the morning, and
dressed and went out.</p>

<p>I know that I walked into the hotel at Hammerstone
Market quietly enough; I was half way up the stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
leading to my room before the startled landlord came
out, and called after me to know where I was going.
I turned, and faced him on the stairs.</p>

<p>"I'm going to my room to put my things together,"
I answered. "Is Mr. Hockley up yet?" I steadied
my voice, and made the question as careless as I could.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hockley's gone, sir," said the man, in what
was evidently a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>I came down the stairs, and faced him for a moment
in silence. "That's not true," I said quietly; "he's
afraid to meet me, and you're hiding him."</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord, sir, he's gone," said the man
earnestly. "I didn't like the look of you last night,
sir; and I like the look of you still less this morning.
No offence, sir, but I'll be glad when you're out of
my 'ouse."</p>

<p>I packed my bag, and arranged for it to be sent to
the station; then I tramped back to find my guardian.
I found him seated at breakfast, quite alone; Mr.
Patton had not yet come down. I told him that I
had been to the hotel, and that Hockley was gone. I
think he seemed surprised, and a little taken aback
at the news.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do?" he asked,
after a silence, during which he had been twisting his
long fingers about over each other nervously. "Are
you going to let the matter drop, or what are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to follow him; I'm going to find him,"
I said. "You know where he lives in London; you
must give me the address."</p>

<p>"I won't do that," he replied instantly; "I'll
have no hand in this business. Let him say what
he likes, or do what he likes; it's no affair of mine, and
it should be no affair of yours. I wash my hands of it."</p>

<p>He went on with his breakfast again, muttering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
himself something about young hot-headed fools;
I waited patiently. I brushed aside his suggestion
that I should have some breakfast; I was impatient
to be gone. I told him again that I must have Hockley's
address.</p>

<p>"Look here, Charlie," he said at last, "I'm going
to London by a train which leaves in half an hour;
you can come with me. We'll talk over this matter
in the train, and I'll see if I can't bring you to a more
sensible frame of mind."</p>

<p>To that I agreed, and we presently started together
for the station. During our journey I urged two
things upon him: that I must have sufficient money
to pay my debt to this man, and that I must have
this man's address. He flatly refused to let me have
the address; the money he said he would forward to
Hockley himself.</p>

<p>"You promise that?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I'll send him a cheque directly I reach the office,"
he replied earnestly.</p>

<p>I urged him again to let me know where the man
lived, but he would not. Finally, however, he said
he would think the matter over; if I would call at
his office in the City that evening, he would let me
know his decision. With that I had to be content;
and I left him at the station, and after taking my
luggage to my rooms, set off to kill the day as best I
could.</p>

<p>I reached Jervis Fanshawe's office in the late afternoon,
to find that he was gone. But he had left a
note for me; I tore it open, and read it there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have sent a cheque to Gavin Hockley to cover
the full amount you are indebted to him. I enclose
his address, because I think that you are the best judge
of what you should do.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"J. F."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>I tore the note up, having got that address clearly
in my mind, and set out to find Hockley. I remember
now that a curious calm had come over me&mdash;a
curious feeling of deadly certainty as to what I
wanted, and what I meant to have. I was no
longer in his debt; I could stand face to face with
him on absolutely equal terms. And I would have
you bear in mind that I did not mean to kill him.</p>

<p>No&mdash;I did not mean to kill him. There was a
thought in my mind that I might beat him to his
knees, and force him to say the truth; that I might
compel him, in fact, to write it down: nothing more
than that. But my rage and my abhorrence had
grown into a deadly thing, more dangerous than the
passion of the night before; I did not know then
what I have recognized since, that I had no real control
of myself, and that I had sprung as it were, in
one single instant, above any law that might be made
by man. And I was in that condition when, in the
coming gloom of the evening, I turned into Lincoln's
Inn Fields, and looked for the place where Gavin
Hockley lived.</p>

<p>It was a curious old house, with a great flagged
courtyard in front of it; it had once been the house of
some great man, before Lincoln's Inn had been invaded
by lawyers and others in search of chambers and offices.
I read his name on a plate at the door; I climbed
the stairs, and as I climbed I slowly unbuttoned my
gloves, and took them off. I had no weapon of any
sort, save a light walking cane that would have snapped
at a touch.</p>

<p>I came to the door of his rooms, and read his name
there again.</p>

<p>My heart was beating a little more rapidly than
usual, but I was outwardly calm. I saw that the door
was open an inch or two; without knocking, I thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
it open, and went in. The place was empty. Judging
at first that he had seen me coming, and had bolted
I made a quick movement towards the door of the
room in which I stood, with the intention of setting
out in pursuit; and at that moment heard the outer
door bang, and heard him come in, whistling. I stood
still, just within the door of his sitting-room, and
waited for him.</p>

<p>He came straight into the room, looking neither
to right nor left; it was only as he swung about at the
table that he saw me. I stood quite still, watching
him, and for a moment I saw flash up in his eyes the
look of a hunted creature at bay. He had stopped,
with his hands resting on the table; he seemed to
crouch there, waiting. I made a rapid movement,
and got between him and the door.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked at last, straightening
himself, and putting his hand for a moment to his
collar. I thought then that perhaps he had a difficulty
in breathing, or perhaps he remembered my hands
there on the previous night.</p>

<p>"You ran away from me this morning, because you
were afraid of what I might do to you," I said steadily.
"You can't run now; you've got to face me, and answer
me, and do as I tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" He was getting a little of his
courage back by this time, and some of his old air of
bravado sat awkwardly enough upon him. "And
may I ask what the devil you mean by forcing your
way into a gentleman's rooms like this?"</p>

<p>"I had to meet you, and I chose the only way that
was open to me," I replied. "I went to look for you
this morning, but you had by that time decided that
it was wiser to get out of my way. I want you to take
back the lie you told last night."</p>

<p>I saw him look quickly round the room; I glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
for a moment round myself. I knew that his eyes
sought a weapon; I knew that if he could frighten
me out of the place, or overawe me in any way, he
would laugh at anything I might threaten, and that
my chance would be gone. He made a movement
as if to get past me; I stood still, looking at him.
The momentary glance round the walls had shown
me that the place was very beautifully furnished, and
that weapons of various sorts were fastened about, for
the mere purpose of ornamentation. I saw that it
would become a question as to which of us secured a
weapon first; but even then, as I did not mean to
kill him, I did not make the first move. That I will
swear.</p>

<p>When he moved, it was to snatch a weapon that
seemed characteristic of his clumsy brutality; he
suddenly swooped and caught up a heavy poker from
the fireplace. "It was no lie, and you know it,"
he blurted out. "Every one knows it, if it comes
to that. Get out of my place, you cub, until you can
pay your debts."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are!" I commanded him. "My
debt is paid; a cheque has been sent you to-day.
For the last time, will you take back what you have
said, or shall I kill you?"</p>

<p>He suddenly made an ugly rush at me, swinging
the poker above his head. He was blind with fury
and fear; he did not seem to know where he struck.
I sprang aside, and on the instant wrenched from its
place on the wall a short old-fashioned heavy-bladed
sword. I waited until he should turn to come at me
again; and when he did his lips were spluttering out
words and oaths so frightful, with her sweet name
mixed horribly with them, that I felt I had no option.
I struck down his weapon, and I drove straight at his
head with my own. I struck him twice with all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
force, and saw him drop to his knees, and then on to
his side. And so lay, as in my dream, with blood
upon him at my feet.</p>

<p>I turned round, and walked out of the place. Somehow
it did not seem surprising that on the staircase I
should meet my guardian, Jervis Fanshawe. He
was trembling from head to foot; he took hold of my
arm, and asked me in a shaking voice to tell him for
the love of God what I had done.</p>

<p>"I've killed Gavin Hockley&mdash;and his lie," I said.
Then I went quietly down the stairs, and out into the
summer twilight of Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

<a name="ALAS_FOR_POOR_PRINCE_CHARLIE" id="ALAS_FOR_POOR_PRINCE_CHARLIE">ALAS! FOR POOR PRINCE CHARLIE!</a></h3>


<p>In a great crisis of one's life perhaps the things that
strike one most are those most commonplace.
I remember on that summer evening, when I came
out into the streets, that I was able to think first of
the extreme beauty of the night, and of how quaint
and wonderful the old buildings looked in the softened
light of the dying day. I saw a pair of lovers strolling
on before me, looking into each other's eyes; I remember
thinking then, with a little strange feeling of pride,
that I had killed a man that Love and Truth might
live. I had come out into Holborn, and was making
my way towards my rooms, when my guardian, who
had hovered a little behind me, and had followed me
wonderingly, touched me on the arm. I had forgotten
all about him until that moment.</p>

<p>"Better come home with me," he whispered;
"they'll look for you at your place first."</p>

<p>"It won't make much difference," I said; "they'll
have to find me some time." Nevertheless I went
home with him, walking the short distance to his place
in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>He watched me as we went along, and I saw that
he watched me with an increasing sense of wonder.
I was something detached&mdash;apart from all the world&mdash;something
he had not looked upon before. He was
afraid of me, and yet attracted to me in a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
way; he spoke to me, when he spoke at all, with a
strange deference. I wondered about it, as I might
have wondered about anything that was happening
to some other person, until at last it struck me, and
that with no sense of fear, that he looked upon me as
one already dead. And so we came to the house in
which he lived, and went up in silence to his rooms.</p>

<p>He turned up the light in that room in which we
had played cards, and motioned to a chair; but I
did not sit down. Now that I could see his face distinctly,
I read again in it that look of fierce and eager
excitement that I had seen before; I understood,
too, that I was nothing to him, and only what I had
done made me important in his eyes. I had something
to say to him, and I said it quickly.</p>

<p>"He told me that he had not yet had the money
to redeem my I.O.U.'s," I said. "I suppose the
cheque was delayed?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't sent," he said in reply. "I never
meant to send it."</p>

<p>I turned on him fiercely, and spluttered out his
own words: "Never meant to send it? What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to murder <i>me</i>," he muttered,
putting the table between us, and grinning weakly.
"I tell you I never meant to send it&mdash;I never had
the money to pay it."</p>

<p>I sat down and looked at him; the horror of the
other business was falling away from me in the contemplation
of this treachery. "I want you to explain,"
I said patiently.</p>

<p>"You young fool!" he exclaimed with sudden violence,
as he saw how tame and quiet I was, "don't
you understand that I meant this to happen from
the first? Don't you understand what every one is
going to say when they find him, and when they find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
what is in his pockets? You owed him money; you
had been gambling with him, and had nothing to
pay him with. You quarrelled with him at Hammerstone
Market; you were heard to threaten to
kill him. You follow him to his rooms; he demands
the money; there is a quarrel, and the stronger
and the younger man wins. Oh, you fool!"</p>

<p>"Why have you done it?" I asked him, still very
quietly.</p>

<p>He paced about the room for a minute or two,
and then came back to me. I knew that there was
time enough, and so I waited; I did not see daylight
yet.</p>

<p>"I have been in Hockley's clutches for years," said
Jervis Fanshawe, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone;
"he has bled me steadily for a long time past. I
began gambling with him, and I lost; tried to retrieve
my losses, and lost more. Every penny I ever had
has gone to him&mdash;and other money besides."</p>

<p>"What other money? Mine?"</p>

<p>He nodded slowly. "Every bit of it, and more
besides that. I'm deeply involved with the firm;
that was my chief reason for trying to get hold of
that girl, for with her I could have stopped all tongues
wagging, and could have paid Hockley off. It
was when I saw you, hot-headed and hot-blooded,
and only too eager to quarrel with the man, that the
idea came into my mind that I might use you. That&mdash;and
the story I heard."</p>

<p>I remembered in a flash the story the doctor had
told at that dinner party at the house of old Patton;
of the man who worked on the jealous feelings of
another that he might kill a third man. But my mind
moved slowly, and even yet I did not even quite see
what this man had done.</p>

<p>"I can tell you this now, because you're a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
man to all intents and purposes," said Jervis Fanshawe,
leaning across the table and looking hard at
me. "I always hated you&mdash;hated you, I think, for
your youth and your strength, and that fair boyish
face of yours that gave you a chance with women I
never had. You've served my purpose, and in a way
I never expected."</p>

<p>"Then, when they bring me to justice&mdash;when they
try me for what I have done," I said slowly and patiently,
"that is the story you will tell them?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," he replied. "And you cannot
contradict it."</p>

<p>"I would not contradict it if I could prove the
truth to every one," I assured him earnestly. "And
I thank you from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>He stared at me in amazement. "Are you mad?"
he gasped.</p>

<p>I shook my head, and smiled. "No, I'm not mad,"
I replied. "Only this gives me the chance I never
hoped to get&mdash;the chance to keep her name out of it.
I was afraid you might drag that in, tell of the quarrel
between Hockley and myself, and have sharp lawyers
turning and twisting that lie this way and that. Tell
your tale, by all means; I shall keep silent. Now
give me something to eat; I'm faint and worn out."</p>

<p>I do not think he had understood me before; I
caught him more than once stopping, as he moved
about the room, to look back at me, and to ponder
over me and to shake his head. I was indifferent to
everything; I only thought how wonderfully it had
all come about, that Barbara's name would never be
mentioned; I had not hoped to kill the lie so completely
as this. I ate the food he gave me, and presently
lay down on the hard horsehair sofa in his
sitting-room, and was fast asleep in a minute. I only
woke once during the night, and then I found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
bending over me with a flaring candle held above his
head; there was still that wondering awestruck look
in his face.</p>

<p>I went out long before he was awake in the morning;
I had not yet decided what I should do. That
it would be done for me pretty quickly I already
realized; for it was not likely, after his declaration
of the previous night, that Jervis Fanshawe would
long leave me at liberty. So I took what was to
prove my last walk through London, for that time at
least; and presently saw what I had expected to see.
Flaring lines on newspaper placards told me and all
the world of London what had happened, and the lines
were strengthened as hour after hour went by. In
face of them I had a curious satisfaction in my present
liberty, a curious wonder at the power that was mine.
I could have gone up to any respectable citizen jogging
along his respectable way, and have told him the
truth calmly; I could have shouted it in the streets,
and then have run, with a hundred at my heels. I
was a pariah, walking the streets of a great city with
men hunting for me; I had nothing in common with
respectability or decency.</p>

<p>I remember that I tried experiments that day;
touched the very fringe of what was waiting for me,
in a sense, to try how near I could go to the actual
danger without grasping it. I sat in a crowded
restaurant at lunch time, and heard men talk of what
had happened, giving details of how the man had
been struck down, and offering suggestions as to the
motive. I that was already dead could listen to them
with equanimity; could wonder a little what would
have happened had I suddenly declared how much
deeper my knowledge of the business was than theirs.</p>

<p>One man was quite blatant about it; he had already
formed his own idea of the matter, and had summed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
it up. There was a woman in it, of course; everything
pointed to the fact that a woman had struck
the fatal blow. In the first place there was no evidence
of any struggle; and mark you, gentlemen, a woman
bent on such a business as that would creep upon
the poor devil unawares, and strike him down before
he had a chance to defend himself. It being pointed
out to this clever person that a poker had been found
clasped tight in the hand of the murdered man, he
was ready in a moment with a smiling explanation of
that. The woman had put it there, the better to make
out her defence if necessary. He was quite surprised
that no one had thought of that.</p>

<p>So I went out into the streets again, to find again
what I had expected. The placards bore an additional
line&mdash;"A Clue." Clearly Mr. Jervis Fanshawe had
already been at work.</p>

<p>There was no thought in my mind of escape; I do
not think that idea ever occurred to me. Once or
twice, perhaps, a hot and pitiful feeling swept across
me at the thought that I must pay for what I had
done with my life&mdash;and I so young! But even then
I thought of myself as of some one impersonal and
having nothing to do with me. That was the strangest
feeling of all: to tread these streets, amid these hurrying
crowds, and to feel so bitterly sorry for poor Charlie
Avaline, whose life was ending. But of myself I did
not think.</p>

<p>It was growing dark as I turned into the little narrow
street out of Holborn in which my rooms were
situated. Against the railings of a house opposite to
that in which I lived a man lounged; as I came into
the street he was making a business of lighting a pipe.
Twenty yards away, on the opposite side of the road,
a policeman was standing; I saw that here was the
end of things. As I turned into the street a wretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
forlorn old woman, with a box of matches in her hands,
shambled past me, mumbling something pitifully; I
stopped her, and gave her all the money I had in my
pocket&mdash;all I had in the world. I left her looking
blankly at the coins, and feeling about her deplorable
clothes for some place in which to hide them; then I
walked straight up to the house, and climbed the
stairs; and knew, while I climbed, that the man who
had made a pretence of lighting a pipe climbed steadily
behind me.</p>

<p>I was so young, and life even then was so sweet, that
for a minute after I had gained my room, and while
yet freedom was left to me, I made shift to clasp my
hands and murmur a prayer for strength. I heard
the Law, in the shape of the man with the pipe, on
the landing outside, and for the first time I was afraid;
the passion and the fierceness of the thing had gone
from me. I dropped my head upon my hands, and
whispered what was in my heart&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let me be strong and brave; let me never speak
her name. Let me die silent&mdash;oh, God!&mdash;let me die
silent!"</p></blockquote>

<p>There was a sharp knock at the door; I pulled
myself together, and went to open it. The man was
inside in a moment and had closed it, but not before
I had had time to look past him, and to see the grim
figure of the policeman standing outside. I think at
first the man who had come in, and who now announced
himself, was a little astonished at my youthful appearance;
he asked if my name was Charles Avaline.
Even as I answered him, I felt myself vaguely wondering
what he was like in private life, and if he had a
son, perhaps, of about my age; for he was a pleasant-looking
man of about fifty.</p>

<p>"My name is Charles Avaline," I said steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a warrant for your arrest, Mr Avaline,"
he said, "and I charge you with the murder of Gavin
Hockley last night in his rooms in Lincoln's Inn Fields."
Then, as I was about to speak eagerly, he interrupted
me in a fashion I shall always remember, because it
was so kindly&mdash;almost paternal, in fact. Yes, I felt
sure he must have a boy of about my age.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear boy, don't say anything," he urged.
"You know what it means; I shall only have to use
it in evidence against you. I see you're a gentleman&mdash;I
might have known that by the first look at you&mdash;and
I know you're coming, like a gentleman, quietly. You
can leave it to me; I'll see that everything is as comfortable
and as sparing to your feelings as can be,
consistent with my duty."</p>

<p>"I will give you no trouble," I said. Then, before
he could stop me, I added quickly: "And I did kill
the man."</p>

<p>He shook his head despondently. "I wish you
hadn't said that, but I'm bound to repeat it," he said.
"I always like a man to have a fair chance if I can.
Now, sir, if you're ready we can start."</p>

<p>I looked round the studio in which I had been for
so short a time; I thought of all the dreams I had
dreamed there, of all that I was to have done to make
a great name in the world. I felt that the man was
watching too, and yet he had in his eyes something
of that wondering perplexed look that I had seen in
the eyes of my guardian. I walked out on to the
staircase, where the policeman was still standing, and
the man I had left in the room extinguished the light
and followed me. He motioned to the constable to
go ahead of us; when we got into the street a cab was
just drawing up. I got in, and the man followed;
the constable swung himself up to the box beside the
driver, and we set off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not think I was surprised to find my guardian
hovering about in the hall of the police station; the
only point that was remarkable was that he was nervous
and anxious, and I was not. I think, in view of
what I had to face, and of the desperate strait I was
in, I looked upon him then as something so much
smaller and meaner and more commonplace than
myself. Not that I would have you believe that I
regarded myself in any heroic light, but rather that
I had done with this troublesome business of life, had
fought my fight, and was going out into the shadows.
And yet was so sorry, so desperately sorry for poor
Charlie Avaline!</p>

<p>"My dear boy!" he began, as I walked into the
place; but I checked him with a laugh as I thrust
him aside.</p>

<p>"You've managed it more promptly than I should
have thought possible," I said. "You'd much better
go home."</p>

<p>I pass over all that happened before my trial. If
I seem to touch upon it at all, or to endeavour to make
you understand what were my thoughts at that time,
it is only because of the old human instinct that every
man and every woman has to justify what he or she
has done. And at that time I suppose my chief
thought, naturally enough, was of what the end would
be for poor Charlie Avaline; of what people would say
to him and about him; of how much he could bear,
and whether, in the stress of the time that was coming,
he could keep silent. But on that latter point I felt
pretty certain, and was not afraid.</p>

<p>So the day came when I stepped up through the
floor, as it seemed, and came out into a railed-in space,
and faced my judge. I seemed to hear about me a
rustling and a murmur that died down at once. I
saw near to me the man who held my life in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in the sense that he was so hopelessly to defend me;
I caught sight of my guardian, seated near to me,
with lips twitching, and with his white fingers coiling
over each other ceaselessly. And then in the silence
a voice asking me how I pleaded.</p>

<p>"Guilty!"</p>

<p>There was a great excitement then, with my counsel
excitedly whispering to me, and people murmuring in
court; it seemed that I had outraged all the legal
technicalities. Why could they not be done with it
at once, and take my word for what had happened?
I did not want to be set up there, to be stared at and
pointed at; I had done with the world, and they
had but to pass sentence upon me. I was tired of
the sorry game; I wanted to go down the steps again
quickly, and be lost to the world.</p>

<p>But it seemed that there was much to be done.
My plea was amended; legally, it appeared, I was not
guilty after all until I had been tried. And in that
mock fashion (for so it seemed to me) I was tried on
that dreadful charge, and all the sorry story was gone
into again.</p>

<p>The court was packed; I remember noticing that
there were many women present. I looked at the jury;
and in that curious fashion in which small things
appeal to us in great crises, I noticed one man with a
bald head and a mild and innocent-looking face; I
thought he seemed a little sorry for me, and I wondered
about him, and longed to tell him that it did not matter,
and that he need not be afraid of my feelings when he
came to give his verdict. I felt quite anxious about
that little innocent-looking juryman; I would have
been so glad to comfort him.</p>

<p>It seemed that they had a great many people there
I had forgotten. There was the landlord of the hotel
at Hammerstone Market, and a waiter and a chambermaid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
they had come to give evidence to the effect
that they had heard me threaten to kill this man,
and that they had broken in upon our struggles. The
chambermaid was a young and pretty girl, who wept
as she gave her evidence, and persisted in referring to
me as "the young gentleman," despite their protestations
that I should be dubbed "the prisoner." Then
they all seemed to fade into the background, and my
guardian stood to give evidence against me.</p>

<p>An unwilling witness this, my lord; a man dragged
here by the stern arm of a subpoena to give evidence
against this young man, whose friend and guardian he
has been; you must not be surprised, my lord, if he
should break down! He has tried hard to shield the
prisoner already; such knowledge of the crime as he
possessed has only been dragged out of him with
great difficulty. Bear with him gently, my lord, and gentlemen
of the jury, for his position is truly a pitiful one!</p>

<p>Mr. Jervis Fanshawe answered the first question in
so low a tone that it was difficult to hear him. He
had loved this boy, it appeared, as he might have
loved a son of his own; he had watched his growing
up, and had provided him with everything that was
necessary for his proper education and for his placing
out in the world. But he had noticed from the first
a tendency on the part of this misguided boy to leave
the beaten safe paths, and to take his own way in the
world. The modest fortune entrusted to that guardian's
care for the boy had long been exhausted, and Mr.
Fanshawe had only too willingly paid certain expenses
out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>I looked at him keenly then, and he lowered his
eyes; but as he shook his head despondently at the
same time, it was naturally concluded that he had
long since come to the belief that there was not much
to be done for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>He was asked to come to the events of that night
at the inn at Hammerstone Market, and he did so
with reluctance. There had been bad blood between
these young men, and he had endeavoured to put
things right between them. He had given a modest
supper, and had hoped that they would shake hands
afterwards and be friends. Unfortunately, however,
they had started again that business of card-playing
that had been the original cause of the trouble between
us.</p>

<p>"I take it, Mr. Fanshawe, that you were aware
that this I.O.U.&mdash;I refer to the first one&mdash;had been
given by your ward to the dead man."</p>

<p>"I saw it written," was the answer.</p>

<p>"And the second one was given on the night before
the murder?"</p>

<p>"Under similar circumstances&mdash;yes," replied Fanshawe.</p>

<p>It further came out, under skilful examination, that
this worthy Mr. Jervis Fanshawe had actually got the
prisoner away to London, and had refused to reveal
the whereabouts of Gavin Hockley; had only yielded,
in fact, under the belief that the two young men were
to make up their differences. I watched him closely
during this time, but he avoided my eyes as much as
possible, and gave his evidence in short jerky sentences;
I believe it was felt that he was labouring under strong
emotion.</p>

<p>My counsel had before him a task that was hopeless
enough. I would tell him nothing save that I had
killed the man; I was deaf to all his pleadings. He
could only do what was in his power to upset the
evidence that had been given; he started on a track
with my guardian that amazed and frightened me.</p>

<p>"You went down to Hammerstone Market, Mr.
Fanshawe, with your ward, to attend a wedding?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
he began. "Can you tell us if the prisoner had any
interest in any way in that wedding?"</p>

<p>"He knew the parties, as I did," replied my guardian.</p>

<p>"There was no possibility of any quarrel having
arisen out of any jealous motive?"</p>

<p>I held my breath, and wondered what the man
would say. He glanced at me for a moment; I do
not exaggerate when I say that he cowered beneath
the look I gave him.</p>

<p>"I do not understand the question," he said. "The
people were intimately known to me, but were mere
acquaintances of the prisoner."</p>

<p>There came the speech of the prosecuting counsel.
This young man, of good education and good prospects,
had gambled recklessly with another man, and
had found himself in an impossible position. He
might have gone, gentlemen of the jury, with confidence
to this guardian, who was his best and his dearest
friend, and have appealed to him to liquidate his debt;
instead of that it was evident that he had determined
to try conclusions with the man who held these incriminating
scraps of paper. What passed behind the
closed doors of the unfortunate man's rooms it was
impossible to say; they could only conjecture. It must,
however, be suggested that the prisoner, terrified at the
thought of the position in which he had placed himself,
had gone late at night to the rooms of the man to
whom he owed this considerable sum of money; they
might imagine him pleading with that man, then
threatening and demanding, then endeavouring to
obtain by force that which he could obtain in no
other way. It might be urged that these papers had
been found upon the dead man, but surely that could
easily be accounted for. Even the most callous could
scarcely stoop to search the blood-stained thing that
lay in that quiet room at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>My counsel did the best for me that he could; he
threw himself, alike with me, upon the mercy of the
court. I had refused to say anything; he confessed
that he was utterly in the dark as to my motive. But
he could plead my youth, and the fact that Gavin Hockley
was a bigger and apparently a stronger man, with
a reputation that was not too clean. Was it not
possible that these two hot-headed men&mdash;the prisoner
a mere boy&mdash;had got into some quarrel, and had
attacked each other without thought; had not a weapon
been found in the hand of the dead man? This could
be no question of murder; there was nothing deliberate
about it at all.</p>

<p>I remember that the judge summed up dead against
me. He disagreed with the suggestion that the act
was not premeditated; there were the various attempts
I had made to get the address of my victim; the determination
I had shown; my threats to kill the man,
if I could only stand face to face with him. The
duty of the jury was clear; unless they had any reasonable
doubt there was but one verdict they could return.
It was all short and sharp and direct to the point;
the jury went out of court, and I remember that the
little innocent-faced one looked back at me pityingly
as he went. I almost called out to him not to mind.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to consider their verdict;
I was hurried back into court within a few minutes.
The usual formal questions were asked; and for a
moment my heart beat a little quicker as I heard the
verdict given. It was the one I had already given
myself.</p>

<p>"Guilty!"</p>

<p>For a moment there was a sort of mild tumult in
court; people whispering and jostling about, and
here and there a voice raised&mdash;either in protest, or in
condemnation of me; I do not know which. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
silence; and another figure on the bench, a little
behind the judge, adjusting a black square of cloth
upon his wig. I remember thinking, in an absurd
way, that he had not put it on quite straight.</p>

<p>The judge had already lifted his hand impressively,
and had spoken my name, when the voice of a woman
rang out clearly in the gallery above me. It was as
though some tender-hearted creature there could not
bear that this thing should be done.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>She was silenced at once, and the solemn voice that
had begun to address me went on with what it had
to say. It had been, it seemed, a revolting crime&mdash;born
of a man's evil passions; it must meet the
penalty set out in the law. The recommendation of
the jury to mercy on account of my youth should be
forwarded to a proper quarter; but the duty of the
judge now was clear. I listened patiently until the
last words came to me across the hushed court&mdash;</p>

<p>"And may God have mercy on your soul!"</p>

<p>I stood still for a moment, and looked about me
over that sea of faces, all turned, without exception,
in my direction. The little juryman was dabbing
at his eyes, without any attempt at concealment;
my guardian was watching me, with nervous fingers
plucking at his lips. Then it all faded, like a dream
that was ended, and I went swiftly down out of the
world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />

<a name="I_LEAVE_THE_WORLD" id="I_LEAVE_THE_WORLD">I LEAVE THE WORLD</a></h3>


<p>Although in my uneasy slumbers I killed Gavin
Hockley a hundred times at least&mdash;saw him
lying at my feet, and realized clearly what I had done&mdash;I
cannot say that such hauntings filled me with
any horror in my waking moments. The thing had
been done, and I had the savage certainty that it had
been done well. Almost it seemed to me that I had
gone before the woman I loved, and cleared the path
for her&mdash;striking out of my way and hers the noxious
thing that had menaced her. That was well done,
and the path was clear; what else could matter?</p>

<p>It would be idle to suggest that I did not think
about my fate. So many days in which to live, and
with each morning one the less; so many times to
look upon the faces of those who guarded me; so
many meals to be got through; that was all. Then
would come that last dreadful morning when they
would wake me; when I would get, perhaps, a glimpse
of the sunshine for which I longed, and would hear
the passing bell; then&mdash;"to hang by the neck until
you are dead."</p>

<p>In the time that was left me I travelled many, many
miles. I seemed to see myself in a sort of perspective,
narrowing down to the years that I could first remember,
when I had been a child. I saw myself a happy
boy at school; remembered the names of other happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
boys, who would read of my fate, and shudder at what
I had done; for I had been regarded as a gentle, amiable
creature at school; I do not think I had ever even fought
a boyish battle. They would talk about me&mdash;would
say: "Why, I knew this chap at school!" and so
would gain some temporary notoriety from the knowledge.</p>

<p>I remembered again a happy year or two in an old-fashioned
German town; thought with tears of loyal
brave friendships formed then&mdash;friendships that were
never to be broken this side the grave. How we had
mapped out then all we were to do&mdash;this man a writer,
and this other a painter, and this stronger one a
soldier! And then I fell to wondering in what obscure
place within the prison they would bury me&mdash;for my
bones to be found afterwards&mdash;long, long afterwards;
when perhaps they might recall how young I was, and
how brutal my crime.</p>

<p>I think they were all sorry for me; I know that
they were gentler with me than with other prisoners.
Once or twice the man who had prepared my defence
came to see me; it seemed that they were preparing
a great petition, to save me if possible from the gallows.
I protested against that; it was not what I wanted.
No living death for me, herded with criminals for the
rest of my days; let me walk out as bravely as I
could, and face the penalty. I protested strongly
against the suggestion that I should be given any other
fate than that I had earned. Nor would I in any way
give them help for the framing of their petition; they
had heard the evidence, and it was true&mdash;and what
more did they want?</p>

<p>They plagued me to such an extent that at last I
refused to see the man at all; but still I understood
that the petition went on, and was being signed widely
everywhere. I was so young&mdash;and, God help me!&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
good-looking, they told me&mdash;that there was every
reason for the hysterical outpourings of sympathy;
had I been old and hardened, never a word would
have been said.</p>

<p>The good chaplain I listened to&mdash;hearing the simple
comforting words that I had heard many and many
a time in the old days at school. It seemed strange
that I should hear them now, in this place, where I
was shut away until the time came for them to kill me!
My life had been clean and wholesome&mdash;there was
nothing very heavy that I had to carry before
my God, save that slaying of a fellow-man. And
it seemed more than possible that God would understand.</p>

<p>The long days dragged themselves out, until there
were but three left. I was in a mood to wish that they
might hurry the business on; I had begun dreadfully
to count the days, and then the hours; and there was
a torture in that. I would have welcomed any man
who came suddenly into my cell, and announced that
then and there I must walk out to die; it was the
knowledge that I must wait&mdash;must hear the clock in a
distant church tower lopping off my life by inches,
even in the still watches of the night; that was the
terror of it. In mercy they might have stopped that
clock&mdash;might have tried to cheat me a little as to the
progress of the days; but that was all a part of my
punishment.</p>

<p>And now I come to a strange thing that happened
to me in that place of torture&mdash;a strange thing, sent
for my comfort. You are to understand that two
men watched me night and day, and their watches
were relieved at regular intervals. I, who had so little
to occupy my attention, came to watch for the changes,
and for the new faces that greeted me when the time
for changes came round. The men were good fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
despite their occupation; I put it on record here that
they were considerate and even courteous to me; I
read a deep pity for me and my fate in the eyes of
more than one of them.</p>

<p>It had come to that night when there were but three
days left. I had eaten my meal, and had got into my
bed; I liked that time best, because of the stillness,
and because I liked to feel, poor doomed mortal that
I was, that all the great city slept quietly about me,
with every man and woman in it each with their
separate trouble and their separate grief. I lay a thing
apart, condemned to die; and there was in my mind
the curious feeling then that it was strange that the
needs of the world were such that a fellow-man had
been able to say that I should die, and that other
fellow-men were appointed to watch me that I did not
escape, and that yet another fellow-man had the
dreadful task of killing me, just as I had killed Gavin
Hockley. Lying on my bed in my cell I thought of all
that, and watched the men who were seated silently
near me. And then I fell asleep, quite peacefully;
and in that sleep I dreamed a dream.</p>

<p>The end wall of my cell was down, and it seemed
as though I looked out beyond it over green fields, on
to a place I knew. It was just as though one sat in some
strange theatre, and saw through where the wall had
gone to some scene beyond. At either side of the
stage of that theatre, as it were, sat the motionless
warders; the auditorium was my cell. And then I
thought that I got up from my bed, and passed straight
between them, and out to the freedom of the woods
and the fields; leaving them motionless, and even
looking behind for a moment, and seeing the empty
bed there in which I had so recently lain.</p>

<p>I think I knew then, unconsciously, that I must go
back to that cell, and that the vision would fade; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
am certain that I thought that. But for the moment
I was free; I had passed into some strange country,
and yet a country I knew. Then, just as in the fairy
tales, I seemed to turn a corner, and found myself
suddenly in the wood in which I had met Barbara.
And it was the most natural thing in the world that
she should come towards me out of the wood, smiling,
as I had seen her smile before.</p>

<p>It was only when I reached her, and held her hands,
and looked into her eyes, that I realized in my dream
that she knew what had happened; there were tears
in the dear eyes I loved.</p>

<p>"You are sorry for me?" I said, holding her hands.
We seemed to be quite alone in the wood, and the sun
was shining, just as it had shone on that day I met her
first.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say to you," she replied.
"Of course I understand everything about it, and
why you did it; I need not ask you about that. It
was done for my sake&mdash;but oh, the pity of it!"</p>

<p>I remember telling her in my dream that I was quite
happy and quite satisfied; I remember impressing
upon her that I was not afraid. And then it seemed
that we talked of other things, quite as though this
death that menaced me had been brushed aside, and
could not happen. And when the time came that we
seemed to know with certainty that my freedom was
done, she put her hands on my shoulders, and looked
in my eyes, and spoke words that I remembered distinctly
when I woke.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand that I am travelling
night and day, and alone, to come to you, Charlie. I
have been with my husband in a strange place abroad,
where I have heard no news; the dreadful news of
you only reached me an hour ago. I am stopping for
nothing; my eyes see only one thing&mdash;the prison where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
you lie. I will reach you&mdash;God willing&mdash;before they
kill you."</p>

<p>She kissed my lips; and with the kissing I woke,
and looked about me. The warders still sat grim and
motionless; one of them, as I stirred, turned and asked
if I wanted anything. I thanked him, and said I
wanted nothing; and I closed my eyes, and tried
again to sleep. But sleep would not come to me, and
I thought only of Barbara in the wood, and of what
she had said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will reach you&mdash;God willing&mdash;before they kill
you!"</p>

<p>If she came now she must undo all that I had given
my life to do; she must spoil my sacrifice. If she
reached me before I died, I must begin the fight again,
strenuously denying what I knew she would say. I
began to tremble at the thought of that; almost I
made up my mind that if she reached England in time
I would not see her. And yet I repented of that;
because I knew that if I refused to see her, she would
tell her story to those most interested, and I should
be powerless to stop her. I spent the rest of that long
night lying awake there, staring at the ceiling of my
cell, and wondering what I should do.</p>

<p>With the coming of the day I began to realize that I
did not know how near she might be in that race with
Death. At any moment she might be here, within my
prison; and I might find myself face to face with her
and her pleading. For I knew that if once I looked
into her eyes, and held her hands, it was all up with
me; I must speak the truth. More than that, in the
dream I had had of her she had declared that she knew
the truth already.</p>

<p>The night of that day came, and once again I found
myself in my cell, gradually falling to sleep. And
once again the end wall disappeared, and I passed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
between the warders into the wood wherein I had met
her. The vision was exactly the same as on the previous
night; only now it seemed to me that she looked
at me more anxiously, and that there was a strange
wistfulness in her voice when she said the words:
"I will reach you&mdash;God willing&mdash;before they kill you!"</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I had no thought of stopping her
in my dream; I seemed only anxious to look into her
eyes, and to hold her hands, and to snatch from that
dear contact what comfort I could for the time yet left
me on earth. Exactly as on the previous occasion
the dream faded again; and I was in my cell, with the
patient warders watching, and with the faint murmur
of the waking city outside. And now I began to
wonder if after all the dream had only been born of my
own thoughts and desires&mdash;began to hope, even with a
sense of disappointment, that perhaps after all she
was far away with her young husband, and would only
know of my fate long afterwards.</p>

<p>The next night the same thing happened; save that
on this occasion I wandered the wood forlornly enough,
and could not find her. I remember that I seemed to
walk about the sunlit place, calling her name, and hearing
nothing; that I thought more than once that I
saw her disappearing in the distance, and ran on, crying
to her, and finding no one. When I awoke, for
the first time since my sentence I found my pillow wet
with tears.</p>

<p>One more day and night of life. And now I began
violently to long for her; to feel the bitter injustice
of dying here in this place without seeing her. With
one moment I would pray earnestly that she might
not arrive in time; in the next would be faint with
longing to hold her hands and hear her voice. It is
safe to say that I never lost sight of that girlish figure;
I thought of nothing else. The voice of the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
chaplain went by me like a thing unheard; if I listened
at all, it was to hear him saying over and over again:
"Barbara!"&mdash;"Barbara!"&mdash;"Barbara!"&mdash;over and
over again as in a sort of chant.</p>

<p>It was growing late in the afternoon, and I was
seated on the side of my bed, with my face buried in
my hands, thinking. Even then I did not think of
the near approach of death; I only longed insanely,
now that my hour was coming, to live a little longer,
that I might see her. I must have fallen into a sort
of stupor; for I know it seemed to me the prison wall
was down again, and that once again I had stepped
out into the blessed sunlight of the free woods; when I
felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and, looking up, saw
one of the officials. He said something to me that I
did not understand, and I got dazedly to my feet;
looking past him, I saw Barbara, with her hands
stretched out to me. And she was all in black.</p>

<p>At first I remember that I laughed, and looked
stupidly from one to the other of the men about me.
Then, at a sign from the man who had spoken, they
fell back, and went to the further end of the cell.
And I was quite suddenly in her arms.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about it all was that she was so
brave and so strong&mdash;braver and stronger than I was.
I remember that she comforted me as she might have
comforted a child&mdash;called me, again and again, her
dear, dear boy; whispered again and again that they
should not kill me. I was content just to hold her,
and to listen to her voice; I thought of nothing else,
save of the hopelessness of it all; for I felt that I was
wiser than she was, and that I knew the thing to be
inevitable. I don't know what power she had exercised,
or in what strenuous fashion she had set to work to
gain this last interview with me; I only remember
with gratitude that they left us alone, and that we sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
side by side on the low bed, and talked in whispers. We
were both so young that perhaps they relaxed the
rules a little, and felt that it did not matter.</p>

<p>"I was far away&mdash;abroad&mdash;and I had no news,"
she began.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," I replied. "And you travelled
night and day since then to reach me."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" she demanded quickly.
And then I told her of the dreams I had had, and how
I had met her in the wood, and how I had known from
her own lips that she was coming to me.</p>

<p>She looked at me strangely, passing one hand over
her forehead, as though by that mechanical action to
clear her mind. "That is very wonderful, Charlie,"
she said, when I had told her the words she had used.
"I said to myself, over and over again, while the slow
trains crawled across the countries, and the slow ship
ploughed across the sea&mdash;I said again and again those
words to myself: 'I will reach you&mdash;God willing&mdash;before
they kill you!' That is very wonderful."</p>

<p>"Nothing is wonderful with us," I replied, with a
quick laugh that made the men turn and look at me
curiously.</p>

<p>"When I heard what had happened, I scarcely knew
at first what to do; and then I knew that I must come
back&mdash;that I must see you, even if everything else
proved hopeless. Lucas would have stopped me;
he said it was no affair of mine, and that I must not&mdash;should
not mix myself up in it. So I got away at
night, and came straight to you; it was the least that
I could do. Now you are to tell me everything that
has happened&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"You will have heard already, Barbara dear, all
that has happened&mdash;and why I killed him. It was a
quarrel&mdash;a matter of money."</p>

<p>She looked at me with a world of understanding in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
her eyes. "That is what you have told every one;
it is not what you can tell me," she said. "Think,
dear"&mdash;she laid her hand on my arm, and her lips
were quivering, although she spoke bravely enough&mdash;"you
are to die to-morrow; by the love there is between
us, you must not let me believe that you killed a man
for such a thing as that. Unless you would kill my
soul for ever."</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing else," I replied as steadily
as I could. "Perhaps I was not, after all, half so good
as you in your love for me believed."</p>

<p>"You will at least not lie to me," she pleaded.
"Tell me at least one thing: was there no talk about
me between you?"</p>

<p>I did not answer, but my eyes must have done that
for me; she went on, with a little quick note of triumph
in her voice. "Ah&mdash;I begin to understand. He
slandered me&mdash;said something of me that your love
would not allow?"</p>

<p>"Barbara," I broke in hoarsely, "whatever has
happened has been done by me of my own free will,
and I must pay the penalty. As I hope to meet my
God, and as I hope I may be understood then, I beg
you will ask me nothing more. I pay with my life;
don't take my victory from me."</p>

<p>"Then I was right," she exclaimed quickly. "I
seemed to know it from the first. He met me in the
wood that day, just as your guardian had done; he
had met me before at my father's house. I was afraid
of him, as I was afraid of no one else; I could read,
as only a woman can read, what was stamped all over
him. Oh&mdash;my dear&mdash;my dear"&mdash;she had sunk suddenly
to her knees in that dreary place beside the bed
on which I sat&mdash;"he was not worth it!"</p>

<p>"Let one thing be clear between us&mdash;and it is a
dying man who speaks," I said, holding her face between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
my hands, and looking down into her eyes&mdash;"you
must be silent. No word of this must ever pass your
lips, for your own sake&mdash;for the sake of every one. The
time is coming when you will remember me only as
some one who lived, far back in the years, and who
loved and worshipped you; and you will keep what
is our secret."</p>

<p>"I can't do that; it would shame me for ever,"
she whispered. "I <i>must</i> speak; I <i>must</i> make them
understand."</p>

<p>"If you go out of this place, leaving with me a
certainty that you will speak, you kill me doubly," I
said earnestly. "Think what it means to me; nothing
you can do or say now will save me; that is not in our
hands. Let me die, believing that I helped you and
saved you, and I die a happy man. Go out and
spread your story, and tell the truth, and I die shamed
in my own sight, leaving you shamed behind me.
Because the lie I tried to kill will spring alive again, to
be babbled by a hundred tongues."</p>

<p>"But if I do this&mdash;if I promise silence&mdash;is there
nothing I can do&mdash;nothing I can say?" she whispered
brokenly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing you can do," I replied solemnly.
"Think of this: that in the years that are coming it
may happen, in God's own good time, that some child
you love may stand in need of a friend who will strike
as I struck&mdash;fight as I fought&mdash;for her honour. It
may happen, long after I am dead, and forgotten by
all but you, that some such an one may spring up, to
do again more perfectly what I did&mdash;springing from
the dead ashes of my past to work out the pitiful story
I began. Remember that&mdash;and don't stop me in what
I try to do."</p>

<p>I did not know then the full meaning of what I said;
all that was to come upon me later. I did not then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
understand how strangely prophetic my words were,
nor how strangely that prophecy was to be fulfilled.
For the moment I had succeeded in my purpose; she
promised me solemnly that she would keep silence.</p>

<p>Of our farewell I will not speak; she whispered to
me words too sacred to be written here. Then, as it
seemed, the prison wall went down, and she faded out
into the world; the prison wall came up again, and
shut me in. But it shut in a stronger and a better
man.</p>

<p>I had no further vision of her; my prison had shut
me in permanently, and I dreamed of her no more,
save in my waking thoughts. I did not sleep that
night; I remember that I lay there quietly, with my
hands clasped under my head, looking up at the ceiling,
and thinking about her; seeing her going on through
the long years to come, living her quiet life, and carrying
me always in her secret remembrance. That was
good; that was very good. Many a man has died
with a less blessed thought than that in his mind at
the end.</p>

<p>But I was not to die in that sense, after all. Quite
early in the morning&mdash;that morning on which I had
set my mind steadily as the one that meant the end
for me&mdash;the governor came to my cell, and announced
to me that I was reprieved. I was totally unprepared
for it; at first I could not understand what he meant.
But he told me that on account of my youth the death
sentence had been commuted to penal servitude for
life.</p>

<p>On account of my youth! I laughed aloud when
he said that, because the irony of the thing was so
great and so bitter. I was to be shut away for the
rest of my natural life&mdash;in a living death worse than
any I had anticipated. I remember that I prayed
him almost wildly to disregard the order&mdash;to set it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
aside&mdash;to declare that it had arrived too late; and I
know that he seemed surprised that I, so young,
should long so ardently for death.</p>

<p>So I passed out of the cell from which I had thought
to pass only on one last journey, and went away to
the place where I was to serve my sentence. And
the only thing that troubled me&mdash;the only thing about
which I thought at all in that new change of events&mdash;was
what Barbara would think or do when she knew.
For myself I did not care; I had died before, at that
moment when the wall of the prison had seemed to
go down, and Barbara had gone out of my life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

<a name="MINE_ENEMY" id="MINE_ENEMY">MINE ENEMY</a></h3>


<p>So many steps the length of my cell&mdash;beginning
with the heel planted against the wall under the
high window, and finishing at the door; so many steps
across&mdash;beginning with the heel planted against the
wall opposite the bed, and finishing at night at the
bed itself, or in the day, when the bed had been turned
up against the wall, at the opposite wall. Beside the
door the heavy sheet of ground glass that made another
window, outside which a light burned at night for a
certain time; before that ground glass a wooden slab,
fixed firmly in the wall, for a table; a stool for seat.
And on the table my Bible. And that was my home
for twenty years!</p>

<p>At first, when I realized what it meant: that I was
to live there for all my life&mdash;that ambition, hope, and
all that made life worthy had been stripped away from
me&mdash;I rebelled fiercely. If I had had any chance to
kill myself I should have done it; because this was so
different from anything I had planned. I saw the
years stretching on before me&mdash;seemed to see the very
stones of the place worn by my feet, and I growing old
in captivity, with all the busy eager world going on
outside. Men and women living and loving, and laughing
and weeping; little children being born; the
seasons renewing themselves; and I at coarse toil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
counting the days, and wondering when they would
cease for me.</p>

<p>And yet in time, mercifully enough, I did not count
the days. I knew when Sunday came round, because
there was a difference; one sat in the chapel attached
to the prison, and heard a man speak, and the sound
of singing and of an organ; one looked about on the
faces of other men, prisoners like oneself, and wondered
about them. The same faces were seen in the exercise
yard and in the shops during the week; but Sunday
was a day to be looked forward to, as a break in the
dread monotony of the week. I only counted Sundays
after a time.</p>

<p>After a time, too, the fierce rebellion passed; I
was getting used to things. One gets used to anything,
they say, in this world; one's edges become blunted.
In the course of years mine were blunted so much that
I forgot almost how old I was&mdash;ceased to care, in fact.
And I remember once that when they shifted me from
one cell to another I was resentful, and pleaded to be
put back again; I knew the stones of the other, and
had grown to like them; and this was new to me. It
was like turning a man out of his home, and I was
bitter about it.</p>

<p>My fear at first had been that I might lose what
refinement I had; I strove passionately to remember
what I had been&mdash;to be always something better than
those with whom I was herded. I believe I was a
model prisoner; I read all that I could from the prison
library, and I wrote when they would let me. After a
time I began to write of that first part of my life&mdash;the
free part; I was afraid that in the dull course of the
years I might forget. Although at first the remembrance
of what I had been and what I had done were
strongly with me, in time it all narrowed down to the
figure of Barbara, and rested there; nor would my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
recollection turn to anything else. And during all
those twenty years, wherein time did not stand still
with me, she never changed; in my remembrance
she was always the bright pretty girl of eighteen
years of age whom I had loved so long before. It was
as though she had died, and I had remembered what
she was at the last. And it is safe to say that she was
always with me.</p>

<p>Not that the wall of my prison ever went down, as
it had done once when I lay condemned to death; that
vision never came to me again. But in the night I
dreamed of her&mdash;a mad impossible dream&mdash;that she
waited somewhere near at hand&mdash;always young and
beautiful, and always loving me&mdash;waited until such
time as I should, by a miracle, get out into the world
again. In the first years of my imprisonment I
dreamed that, over and over again; but no other
figure out of the past came to me&mdash;at least, not after
my first remembrance of the world had worn off.</p>

<p>In time, as the years went on, it seemed as though,
as I grew older, a sort of mental mist descended over
all that life I had led before my trial&mdash;so that things
were blurred, and I did not see them distinctly. Mercifully,
too, I grew to take an interest in the work I did
inside the prison walls; to be keen and anxious to do
it well, and to do it better than my fellows. The
prison life had worn and broken me, and I know that
I was prematurely old, and a little feeble and fretful
compared with what I should have been. And I was
shocked one day when, in the tinsmith's shop, I got a
brief vision of myself in a shining sheet of tin; I was
old and haggard, and the little hair I had was quite
grey. It frightened me; and I know that I lay awake
that night, thinking bitterly of the years that had been
stolen from me, and trying to remember how old I was.</p>

<p>Then the time came, quite unexpectedly, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was set free. I cannot now write of that time, or think
of it, without remembering how frightened I was, or
how strange the sensation of freedom seemed to me.
I had noticed that something was different&mdash;had feared
that something was going to happen&mdash;because they
had not cropped my hair for a little time, and would
give me no explanation; and then at last one morning&mdash;one
bitter winter morning, when I flogged myself
with my arms to keep myself warm&mdash;I was sent for to
the governor's room.</p>

<p>I had been there once or twice before, because the
governor took an interest in me, and had tried to get me
to talk. I would never do that, and I fear that he had
thought that I was sullen or morose. He had asked
me about my life before I had come to prison; had
tried even to consult my wishes as to what work I
should do; he had been uniformly kind and considerate.
Now, as I went along to his room, I wondered petulantly
what new thing this was that he wished to say
to me. I did not like the room; it was a dreadful
place to me, hung about with brightly polished steel
chains and fetters, and with only a little table in the
middle, at which he sat while any poor prisoner talked
to him. I was left alone with him there, and he looked
at me for a moment or two in silence. He had been a
soldier, I think; he was a fine-looking old fellow, with a
trim moustache and deep-set grey eyes.</p>

<p>"I have some news for you," he said in his abrupt
fashion, "and I want you to prepare yourself for it.
You are not strong, and I do not want to give you a
shock of any sort."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and wondered dully what he meant.</p>

<p>"If you could have at the present moment anything
for which you liked to ask, what would you choose?"
he asked me.</p>

<p>I shook my head stupidly, and said that I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
know; corrected myself in a moment, and asked, wistfully
enough and almost with tears in my eyes, that
I might have the making of some particular sort of pan
in the tinsmith's shop; I had fancied it greatly, but
they had given it to another man. He seemed touched
by that, and laughed and shook his head; I had never
heard him laugh before.</p>

<p>"An order has come to me from the Home Office in
regard to you," he said. "Can you guess what it is?"&mdash;I
shook my head; I did not understand that anything
could happen to me.&mdash;"An order for your release."</p>

<p>I did not understand, and I suppose I stood staring
at him as stupidly as before. For I had been condemned
for life; what could this mean now? More
than that, I had become settled in the place, and the
idea that I should never leave it had sunk gradually
into my mind, and had nailed me, as it were, to that
spot, so that it would be difficult to tear me from it.
I murmured that I did not understand.</p>

<p>"I have sent reports concerning you again and again
to the Home Office," went on the governor; "I have
been able to point out that you have been an exemplary
prisoner; I have urged that fact upon them again and
again. Do you know, Avaline, how long you've been
here?"</p>

<p>I shook my head; I think I sighed a little. "I
think I've forgotten, sir," I said. "So many winters&mdash;so
many times when the sun shone, and I knew the
summer had come again&mdash;but I have lost count of the
years."</p>

<p>"You were here before my time," he said; and
then added in what seemed to be a hushed voice: "You
have been here for twenty years."</p>

<p>I said again that I had not kept count; I think I
added a little wearily that it did not matter. His
kindly voice went on&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were a boy when you came&mdash;twenty years of
age. You must be forty now&mdash;still a young man.
You have many years before you&mdash;years of freedom,
in which you may live a new life." He spoke kindly
and encouragingly, but the glance he gave me showed
me that he knew I was an old and broken man, despite
my years.</p>

<p>"It is too late for me to begin anything, sir," I said.
"What life I had lies back behind the twenty years;
I cannot take up any broken threads of it now. I did
not expect ever to have to take up any free life again."
I was moving towards the door, beyond which the
warder awaited me, when I came back to him, on a
sudden impulse that I would plead with him. "If I
might stay here&mdash;and go on with what work I have
learnt to do&mdash;I should be happier," I said. "If I wish
to stay, you will not turn me out? God help me&mdash;this
is my home."</p>

<p>He got up hurriedly from the table, and turned away
for a moment, and cleared his throat. "It doesn't rest
with me," he said abruptly at last; "I, like you, can
only obey orders. Clothes will be provided for you, and
a sum of money given you which you have earned;
also you will get an order on the railway company
which will take you to London. And I hope you'll do
well."</p>

<p>I went to the door, turning back for a moment to
thank him for what he had done, and to assure him
again, something to his bewilderment, that I would have
been glad to stop. For I was afraid of the great world
outside, and I was too old and broken to begin again.
I remember that I thought, bitterly enough, as I had
thought before, that it would have been so much better
if they had killed me at the first.</p>

<p>It was a wintry morning when I stepped out through
the great gates of the prison&mdash;a free man. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
all been very kind to me; most of the warders whom
I knew well had shaken hands with me, and had given
me little common keepsakes by which to remember
them; I had been infinitely touched by the fact that
one and all spoke to me as "Sir." I went with reluctant
feet; strange as it may seem, I looked back more
than once hungrily as I went out through the prison
yard that I was to see no more, and through the great
courtyard. A little wicket in the gate opened, and
I shook hands with the man in charge there; and so
left them all behind. Before me stretched a long road
downwards towards a town in the far distance; I saw
smoke rising lazily from its chimneys in the early morning
air; all around me lay the great wastes of snow.
And I alone, as it seemed, in the world&mdash;to begin again.</p>

<p>They had provided me with clothing that was new
and rough, and awkward and ill-fitting; I felt like the
naked impossible thing I was, that had been clothed
and covered up in a hurry, so that men should not
recognize me. I had a little money in my pockets,
and a few odd things that had once belonged to me
and had been carefully kept&mdash;things that had been mine
twenty years before, and were mine again now.</p>

<p>I sat down on a heap of stones near the gates of the
prison, with my mind full of the bitter injustice of the
thing. If I had been in my cell now, I should have
been eating my poor breakfast&mdash;comfortably! I should
have known what the day held for me. And here I
was&mdash;an outcast, and tired already before the day was
begun.</p>

<p>The mere fact of wearing civilized clothing again,
however coarse and common it might be, had brought
back to my remembrance something of what I had
been&mdash;some faint ghostly shadow of it. I found myself
looking at my coarse hands, and at the broken stunted
nails, and striving to remember what those hands had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
been like ever so many years ago when I was a boy.
Then, as a shadow fell across me, I realized that I had
been sitting musing for some time; and looked up
from the hands, to see a man standing in front of
me.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, very thin, and not at all well
dressed. He had a long thin nose with wide nostrils,
and a short beard that was black at the roots and grey
elsewhere. He stood with his hands clasped before
him, and with the cold white fingers turning incessantly
over each other. I wondered in a dull fashion where
he had come from; but as he did not greatly interest
me, I went on again looking at my hands. Then he
spoke my name.</p>

<p>"Charles Avaline," he said, in a curious jerky voice
that was only raised a little above a whisper.</p>

<p>I looked up at him, as I might have looked up any
time during those twenty years at a warder, and spoke
my number. It had been the natural thing to do with
every one. "No. 145," I said, in a dull voice.</p>

<p>The man laughed in a disagreeable fashion as I
dropped my eyes again from his face. "Poor broken
devil!" he muttered to himself, and then spoke my
name again. "Avaline&mdash;Charles Avaline. I don't
want your number."</p>

<p>"They never wanted my name in there," I said,
jerking my head towards the great gates of the prison.
"It was always 145. But I'm Charles Avaline," I
added.</p>

<p>He dropped his hand on my shoulder, and shook me&mdash;pulled
me to my feet, in fact. "What are you sitting
here for?" he demanded. "Don't you know you're
free? Aren't you glad to be free?"</p>

<p>"What's the use?" I asked, with a shake of the
head. "Don't you know I'm dead&mdash;dead to everybody?
I've been in there"&mdash;I nodded at the prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
with a queer sort of pride at the thought&mdash;"I've been
in there twenty years."</p>

<p>"And might have been there another twenty, or
another forty, or more than that, if you'd lived so long,"
he retorted. "They seem to have driven the brains
out of you&mdash;what few you ever had. Look at me;
have you ever seen me before?"</p>

<p>He struck himself on the breast, and leaned forward
to stare at me. I trembled a little before him, but
contrived to shake my head. "I don't remember," I
said. But I knew that some old memory was springing
up in me; I knew that I had seen some such face
as this, perhaps in a dream, a long, long while ago.
Life and memory were stirring so slowly in me yet that
I could remember nothing. I only knew that I existed,
and that I stood trembling in the snow before this man,
and that I was cold and dimly afraid. I knew no more
than that.</p>

<p>"Well, I've waited outside your grave for you until
you came to life again," he said, with another laugh.
"I'm your friend, if you know what that means, and
I want to help you. Take off your hat; I want to
look at you."</p>

<p>That old habit of obedience was so strong in me still
that I pulled off my hat, and stood there, grey-headed,
before him in the winter sunlight. Whoever he was
he seemed shocked for a moment beyond measure;
fell back from me a pace or two with a dropping jaw.</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered; and then in an awe-struck
voice I heard him say again: "Poor broken devil!"</p>

<p>I put on my hat again, and waited patiently to hear
what more he would say; I felt instinctively that in
all the great world in which I stood so forlorn and lonely
this man might chance to be my friend. And I wanted
friends then badly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Avaline?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>I shook my head. "I don't know," I said, with a
glance down the long road that sloped away to the
distant town where the smoke was rising in the still
morning air. "I'm afraid to think."</p>

<p>"Got any money?" he demanded; and I turned
out my pockets, and counted into his hands all I had.
I told him a little proudly that it was what I had earned
behind the great gates that frowned upon us as we
talked.</p>

<p>"All this in twenty years!" He laughed, and
transferred the few coins of which I had been so proud
to his own pocket. "I'm your friend, Avaline," he said.
"Come with me, and I'll look after you."</p>

<p>I want you to understand, if you can, something of
what my feelings were at that time. I had gone into
that place fiercely rebelling against my fate; I had
gone into it young, with the fierce hot blood of life beating
in my veins. Twenty years of it had tamed me
and broken me; it had been a gradual process, but a
sure one nevertheless. Slowly the rot of the prison
had eaten into my soul; slowly and surely I had sunk
to be what I was&mdash;a thing obedient to orders, and
expecting always to have life measured out in scanty
regular doses for my daily consumption. Now, in a
moment, I had been flung upon the world; small
wonder that I turned in fear and trembling to the first
creature that called me by name, and spoke a decent
word to me that was not a command. I had been
tossed out into the world after twenty years; I was
fumbling feebly to find my place in it&mdash;and this man
might be able to tell me. So I went with him down
the long hill into the town; and I felt even then that
I went with the trot that had been mine in the exercise
yard of the prison.</p>

<p>We came down into the pleasant little place; there
were buxom women standing at the doors of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
houses, and whistling boys in the streets, and children
trooping along on their way to school. By that time
I had hold of my companion's arm, the better to keep
up with his easier stride; I turned with him willingly
enough into a little inn in a side street of the town,
where, in a quiet room where we were alone, he ordered
breakfast. When the smoking food was put before me
I laughed, and clapped my hands like a child. He did
not eat much himself; but he seemed greatly amused
and interested at seeing me eat, and seemed, too, to
understand what I felt.</p>

<p>"That puts life into you, doesn't it?" he asked,
peering at me across the table. "That makes you
young again, and ready to face the world&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I nodded gratefully, although I knew that it was my
money that had paid for the meal. When I had eaten
all I could, he leaned across the table towards me, and
looked at me closely. I smiled at him in a friendly
way, because I felt that he had been good to me.</p>

<p>"Charles Avaline&mdash;how old are you?"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment, and remembered what the
governor had said to me before I left the prison. "I
was a mere boy of twenty when I went in there," I
said, "and I have lived there for twenty years."</p>

<p>"A simple sum in arithmetic," said my companion,
with a grim laugh. "There's a looking-glass over the
fireplace," he added, pointing to it; "look at it, and
see what has happened to you in twenty years, my
man of forty!"</p>

<p>I laughed as though this were some great game he
was playing; I got up and went to the looking-glass.
Staring into it I saw a worn lined face, with the eyes of
a tired old man set in it, and crowned with grey hair.
I had not seen myself in a mirror for all those years;
I looked into the startled old face of a man of sixty at
least. Realizing for the first time a little who I was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and what I was&mdash;and understanding perhaps the
tragedy of what I had been&mdash;I turned away, sick at
heart and afraid, and looked at him. He was still
seated there, with his elbows on the table, and with
that grim smile hovering about his lips.</p>

<p>"You're an old, old man," he sneered, "of no use
to any one in the world, and of no use to yourself.
Your life is a thing of the past, and you can't begin
again now. What are you going to do&mdash;how will you
live?"</p>

<p>I told him that I did not know; he seemed so much
stronger than I was, and so much more accustomed
to the big world in which I was expected to move,
that I begged him to help me if he would, and to
show me what I should do. I was so much a child,
after that long burial to which I had been subjected,
that I could not think for myself; indeed it never
occurred to me to ask how this man came to know
my name, or why he had met me at the prison gates.</p>

<p>"I mean to look after you," he assured me. "You
shall live again, Charles Avaline; you shall take up
your life where you thought once you had laid it down.
You have been snatched from death; you shall come
out into the world with me again; you shall come into
your kingdom!"</p>

<p>I went with him placidly enough when presently
we left the inn, and set off through the town. If you
wonder that I should have submitted myself so readily
to him, I ask you to remember the life I had lived, and
the fear in which I stood of this great world that was
closing about me. I was to have the past brought
back to me fully and strongly, but I did not know
that then; I was to live again, in another way, the life
I once had lived, and to understand it in a new fashion.</p>

<p>We came to a railway station, and my companion
took a ticket for London; he seemed to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that I had my pass from the prison&mdash;in fact, he asked
me for it. The station master at the little place looked
at me queerly, but I think he was used to poor prisoners
who came to him with Government slips of paper to
take them to various parts of the kingdom. He shut
us into a third-class carriage alone together, and we
started for London. And on the way, strangely enough,
my companion raked over that long buried past of
mine, and reminded me who I was, and what I was. I
remember that I cowered before him, as I might have
cowered before a judge who knew my record, and was
passing sentence upon me.</p>

<p>"Charles Avaline, twenty years ago you killed a
man," he began.</p>

<p>I nodded my head; I remembered that, at least.
Had I not struck the man down many and many a
time since, and seen him lying at my feet. But in the
long dreary course of the years I had forgotten what it
was for, or why it had been done; I only knew that he
had deserved to die, and that I had done well to kill
him.</p>

<p>"The gallows was built for you, Charles Avaline;
the hangman stood ready for you; the grave yawned
for you. But you were reserved for something else,
Charlie; there was still some work for you to do in the
world."</p>

<p>I leaned forward on my seat, and stared at him;
for there was a dim feeling in my mind that I had met
him somewhere, and that I knew him. The mention
of my name in that form&mdash;"Charlie"&mdash;seemed to wake
within me some old memory that had been dead. His
knowledge of my crime, and of how I had gone down
so near to death, set me wondering what manner of
man this was that had seized me at the very prison
gates, and now held me in his power by his knowledge
of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" I demanded, staring at him fearfully.
"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"You shall know soon enough," he replied, and
relapsed into silence. I sat in a corner of the carriage,
staring at him, and wondering about him; striving to
fit him in with some dream I had had&mdash;a dream that
had begun in some old time before the prison closed
upon me. But the habit of thought had long been
lost to me; my brain was a poor mechanical dull thing,
long rusty for want of exercise. In fact, I do not think
that I should have recognized him at all, if I had not
noticed again that curious action of his thin white fingers,
twining over each other restlessly. I had the courage
to lean forward and pluck off his hat, and stare into
his face. I think I must have shrieked out his name.</p>

<p>"Fanshawe! Jervis Fanshawe!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jervis Fanshawe," he said. "Who else do
you think would be likely to inquire about you, or to
find out what day you were coming out? Who else
do you think would watch and wait for twenty years
to get hold of the man again who ought to have died
twenty years ago. There's blood upon you, Charlie
Avaline, and not all your years of servitude can wipe
it away; but I think I'll stick to you." He folded
his arms, and grinned and nodded at me, as though
indeed he owned me body and soul.</p>

<p>And now the first frail door that held in check the
floods of memory was down, and I began to read the
past. Nothing was sure yet, nothing that I clearly
understood; for at first, like a man who, getting old,
thinks in a circle, and so sees his childhood first and
most clearly, I saw my own boyhood, that had had
nothing in common with this man. But gradually I
began to fumble my way blindly to the point at which he
touched my life. And gradually my old horror of him
swept over me, and taught me instinctively that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
was something to be feared and to be avoided. Without
knowing what I did, I sprang up, and made a leap
for the opposite door of the carriage, with the blind
determination to get out of the moving train. But
before I had got the door open he had wound his long
arms about me, and had pulled me back on to the seat.</p>

<p>"Not that way!" he cried, as I feebly struggled
with him. "Death is not for you&mdash;yet. Don't you
understand that you belong to me; when your time
comes I'll settle what manner of death you'll die.
What have you to be afraid of? We're in the same
boat, you and I; the world has kicked us both pretty
hard; we may do better together than we have done
apart. Don't be ungrateful; your loving guardian
has come back to you after twenty years; we'll see
life together, Charlie."</p>

<p>I shrank away from him, and put up my arm as
though to ward off a blow. "Where are you taking
me?" I asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"To London&mdash;and back into the world," he said,
seizing my upraised arm, and dragging it down, and
shaking me playfully. "There's work for you to do
in the world, Charlie&mdash;great work."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" I asked again, shuddering,
and hiding my face in my hands.</p>

<p>"Before your hair was grey, poor fool, and while
the world smiled upon you, you lived and loved and
laughed. You shall live and love and laugh again;
you shall forget your prison and the fear of death that
has been upon you; you shall live again."</p>

<p>"Who can do all this for me?" I asked.</p>

<p>He tapped himself on the breast. "I can&mdash;and I
will," he said. "There was a woman you loved in
those old days&mdash;have you forgotten her name?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was 'Barbara!'" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" he repeated, and I did not notice the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
sneer that was in his tones. "Barbara it was, and
Barbara you shall see again. She shall rise up in the
flesh before you, and show you what love is&mdash;and perhaps
something else beside!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<a name="GHOSTS" id="GHOSTS">GHOSTS</a></h3>


<p>London terrified me after the long silence of the
prison; I was afraid of it. More than that, I
discovered that I had forgotten my brief experience
of it; so that I should have been unable, even had it
been necessary, to find my way to the old rooms in the
little street off Holborn, wherein I had dreamed my
brief dreams, and wherein the Law had so suddenly
gripped me, and swept me out of the world twenty
years before. But I had this man for guide&mdash;this man
who had been my guardian, and was now, as it seemed,
my friend; I could only cling to him, with some
measure of gratitude in my heart that he should have
remembered me at all, and have come to my rescue
when I was once more flung upon the world.</p>

<p>I gathered that he was poor; there were no signs
about him of that prosperity that had once been his.
Moreover, on reaching London he hurried me into an
omnibus, and took me a long way rattling through
an obscure part of the town to a street of mean houses
abutting on the river; it was a place of houses evidently
let out in rooms. He rang a bell at one house, and
after a long time the sound of shuffling feet was heard,
and the door opened a little way, and a face looked out.
I was not sure at first whether it was the face of a child
or of an old and wizened woman. Then, as the door
was opened a little wider, I saw that it was a shabby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and forlorn-looking girl of about fifteen or sixteen,
dressed in an old skirt and blouse much too big for her.</p>

<p>"All right, Moggs," said Fanshawe, "you needn't
be afraid to let us in." He thrust her aside as he spoke,
and motioned to me with a jerk of the head to follow
him. I went in, and the girl closed the door.</p>

<p>"There's a letter for you upstairs, guv'nor," she said,
calling after Fanshawe, who was mounting the stairs.</p>

<p>He muttered something, and went on his way; I
followed obediently. We came into a forlorn-looking
room, with an untidy bed in one corner, and with
some wretched scraps of furniture scattered about it;
a ragged apology for a carpet covered about half the
floor. A cupboard, with a broken hinge to its door,
swung open in one corner, and disclosed a few plates
and cups and saucers, and some glasses that did not
match. The place was destitute of fire, and was
bitterly cold. Jervis Fanshawe strode out of the
room again, and screamed querulously for the girl.
"Moggs! Moggs!"</p>

<p>She came up in a moment or two; listened calmly
to his volcanic outburst at her; and proceeded to
light the fire. She was the strangest little person I
ever remember to have seen; she went on calmly
with her work, singing to herself under her breath a
sort of melancholy dirge that had no tune nor time
about it, but which seemed in some vague way to
comfort her, much as a man may suck at an empty
pipe, or a baby at a bottle. She took not the faintest
notice of Fanshawe, despite all that he said; she only
looked at me curiously once or twice before finally
quitting the room. By that time my guardian (as I
must continue to call him, for want of a better title)
was deep in the letter he had found on the table.
Finally he thrust it into his pocket, with an exclamation
of annoyance, and turned to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>I suppose the fact of seeing me standing there,
huddled as close as I could to the fire, reminded him
of something in the past; he looked round the room,
and waved his hands, and spoke mockingly.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Charlie Avaline, to my rooms!" he
exclaimed. "Perhaps I should say 'room,' because
there's only one of 'em. Observe the furniture, the
costly appointments, the ease and luxury of it all! To
this have we come, Charlie&mdash;you and I. Who can say
that we haven't done well for ourselves?"</p>

<p>He was on his knees before the fire, stirring it savagely
and striving to make it burn, and muttering about it.
He looked up at me with that old look of contempt
on his face; flung the rusty poker into the grate with
a clatter, and got to his feet. He was in a strange
mood, and I did not know what to make of him. More
than that, I was coming back so slowly to life myself
that I did not trouble very much about him; I had
just those animal instincts to warm myself, and to
get food, and to rest, and nothing more. Whatever old
pulses he had stirred in me with his mention of the
woman I had loved were dropping back into their old
condition. The time was coming when they were to
be stirred and shaken, and brought to full and abundant
life; but his was not the hand to sweep the strings of
my being, and wake any music within me. I had only
a dull curiosity concerning him, and that curiosity he
presently began to satisfy.</p>

<p>"You're such a bloodless thing&mdash;something that has
borne a number for years&mdash;a slave; one doesn't know
how much you understand, or how much you don't,"
he began, looking at me over his shoulder in that old
fashion I dimly remembered.</p>

<p>"I'll try to understand," I replied patiently.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that you should be told certain
things; there's work for you to do, and you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
remember who you are, and what you have been,
before you can undertake it. I've waited a long time
for you, on the chance that you might come into my
hands again; and I'm getting an old man, and time is
precious. Carry your dull mind back, and see if you
remember what <i>I</i> was."</p>

<p>I suppose I looked at him in a troubled way, as one
not clearly understanding; he beat his fist upon the
table, and cried out harshly at me.</p>

<p>"Numbskull! Do you remember what position I
occupied?"</p>

<p>"You had money&mdash;you lived well&mdash;you had many
friends," I began slowly; and he interrupted me
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had friends&mdash;money&mdash;power," he exclaimed.
"The world went well with me, and there were those
who trembled at the sound of my voice. Indirectly
you brought me to this," he added, waving his hand
to indicate the poor room. "When you killed Gavin
Hockley, you let loose a cloud of things that had better
have been hidden; I had forgotten the possibility of
that when I set you on to kill him."</p>

<p>"I killed him because he spoke ill of a woman," I
said, like one repeating a lesson.</p>

<p>"You killed him because I had made up my mind
that you should," he retorted. "However, that's
neither here nor there. Hockley had left behind a
cloud of debts; he had paper signed by me; he had
letters of mine. Even in those first days, when you
were in prison, the thing sprang up alive to confront
me; men whispered those ugly words, forgery and
fraud. You've not been the only prisoner, my fine
fellow."</p>

<p>"You?" I stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>He laughed disagreeably. "Yes, they shut me away
for seven years; and I came out what you see me now&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
man ruined and broken, without a friend in the
world, and without any one to speak a good word for
me. Those I had known were dead, or would not
speak to me; I was too old to make new friends of the
sort I had known before. So I've lived by my wits,
Charles Avaline, just as you'll have to live. While
you've been warm and well-cared for at the expense of
your country, I've been down into the depths, and
have seen strange things. And it's not a nice world
for a man under those circumstances. One longs to
get hold of another man, and to drag that other man
down, and show him that bitter life too," he added
savagely.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm sorry," I said vaguely; I did not know
what else to say. "You see, I have not known what
has been happening. In all the long time (they tell me
it was twenty years)&mdash;in all the long time that I have
been there I have not seen the face of any one I ever
knew before; and I have not heard a voice that was a
voice out of the past, save in dreams. And I never
had a letter."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they forget you easily when you go under,"
said Fanshawe. "As for me, I thought they'd hang
you; and by the time they hadn't done that I was
too full of my own troubles. I suppose you'd like to
know something about the old people and the old days&mdash;eh?"
He thrust his face towards me across the table;
his eyes were hungry. I did not understand then what
was in the mind of the man; his brain was clear and
strong, and his plans already well thought out. My
brain was dull and tired, and I had no plans at all.</p>

<p>"You remember Hammerstone Market?" he went on,
watching me, and perhaps noting the expression of my
face as I heard names I remembered. "All changed
down there, in one way, and yet not changed in another.
Some dead, and some alive. You remember Barbara?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; I loved&mdash;loved Barbara," I whispered
brokenly.</p>

<p>"You shall see her again; talk with her again;
come into her life again." There was a fierce eagerness
about him that held me and frightened me. "That's
what I'm going to do for you; that's what I meant
when I said that I would bring you back to love and
life and laughter. Look round this room&mdash;and then
see it all swept away," he went on with growing excitement.
"I've found one friend who will help us both;
it may happen that we are not poor and forlorn any
more. We have both suffered; it is right that we
should have some little joy in our lives."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" I asked him,
as I had asked before; but he laughed, and would not
answer me.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day in that place, cowering
over the fire, and striving hard to look back into the
past. I found it difficult at first; it was like a closed
book to me, in which only here and there, when I was
able at last to open it, could I decipher a few words&mdash;a
few broken sentences that came like the sigh of a dead
wind blowing over the dead years back to me. I got
up mechanically when I was called to eat what simple
food he put before me, going back afterwards to crouch
over the fire, and to start that burrowing process again
into the lost years.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when I saw him reading
again that letter he had taken from his pocket, and
muttering to himself over it. At last he seemed
suddenly to make up his mind about it; he crammed
it back into his pocket, and put on his hat, and announced
that he was going out. "You can stay here,"
he told me curtly; "no one will interfere with you."</p>

<p>I sat still for a little time after he had gone; and then
an intolerable restlessness seized upon me. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
like a lost spirit; I did not know what to do with myself.
I found myself pacing out again on the floor the
steps that for twenty years I had paced out in my
cell; and finding the room too large, so that the steps
would not fit in. And at last got my hat, and went
out into the streets; and looked about me, with a new
and definite idea for the first time growing in my mind.</p>

<p>Hammerstone Market! At Hammerstone Market
I had been happy once; and there, waiting for me,
and preserved in some strange fashion through all the
years, was the life I had laid down and left behind me.
Why had I not thought of this before? It was the
simplest thing in the world; I had but to go to that place
where I had been happy to pick up again the thread
of my life, and to put together successfully the puzzle
I did not now understand. So I set out for the place,
with a new and happy confidence growing in my mind.</p>

<p>I was but groping yet, and I did not understand
fully what I meant to do. I was but a poor thing,
striving hard to get back to some life I had lost; and
so it happened that I set about it as a child might have
done, and in what seemed to my childish mind the
simplest and most direct way.</p>

<p>I have wondered since what I must have looked like
to any one who saw me then, wandering about in
search of Hammerstone Market. I have a vision of
myself as being tall and thin, and gaunt and old-looking;
with deep eyes that must have been pathetic in
the hopeless weariness that was in their depths. My
years counted as nothing; I was a shabby tired old
man, going back, pathetically enough, to pick up here
and there a thread of the life that had been snatched so
suddenly from me. I knew of no way to reach the
place of my dreams, except to walk; and I only knew
dimly that it lay in a county not very far to the north
of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>By little short of a miracle I found the place, after walking
through the best part of a long winter night. When
once I had got out of London the road had proved to
be a straight one; I walked on and on with dogged
persistency. By the time the morning light was
beginning to break over the country that stretched
before me, I was within reasonable distance of the
place, and my heart was light with a hope it had not
known for years. For I was coming back to the place
where for a little time at least I had lived and loved
and suffered&mdash;and I was to see Barbara!</p>

<p>Even then I had no thought that she could be anything
but the bright girl I had left. Time had stood
still with me, and my life had been so completely a
thing of dreams that she was a dream creature in my
mind still; I could think of her in no other way. I
came back to the place where I had known her after
that lapse of twenty years, but under what different
conditions! I had come there before a mere boy,
with the world at my feet; I crept back now, jaded
and weary and old, to look on the life I had known,
and to find my lost love, who, had I but thought about
the matter clearly and sanely, I must surely have
understood might well be in her grave years before.</p>

<p>The place was unchanged; the mere sight of the old
houses and of the quaint High Street stirred my
memory, and made me see more clearly into that past
in which I was groping. I went on eagerly; I wanted
to find again all that I had lost so long ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was characteristic of my wasted life that
it should be winter now, instead of the summer when
I had first met Barbara in the woods; it was as though
the joy and beauty of it all had been stripped away.
But when I came to the wood at last, with the bare
branches of the trees standing up nakedly against the
sky, a gleam of sun struck across it, making fanciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
patterns on the snow. I sat down on a fallen tree,
and looked about me, with my mind clearing more
and more every minute.</p>

<p>Have you ever closed your eyes, and seen suddenly
and vividly in a mental picture some scene that was
enacted years and years before&mdash;seen the figures moving
in it, just as they did long ago? That was what I saw
then, or began to see, when, suddenly raising my eyes,
I saw standing in the sunlight an easel with a canvas
upon it. I knew then that in some extraordinary
fashion I had dropped back through the years, and had
come again as a young man into the wood. Yet not
as a young man; because now I was poor and old, and
shabby and tired&mdash;and it was winter. There could be
no getting away from that; in spite of the sunlight
it was winter.</p>

<p>I walked up to the canvas, and touched it, to be sure
that it was real. And then, knowing my way clearly,
as it seemed, I walked on into the depths of the wood,
looking about me.</p>

<p>God of mercy!&mdash;she was there! I saw her coming
straight through the wood&mdash;Barbara, with her hands
outstretched, and a smile on her face; I knew her in a
moment. And going towards her, as it seemed, was
myself&mdash;a tall straight youth, with an easy step and
an eager manner, meeting her and holding her hands,
and looking into her eyes. I had slipped behind a
tree, so that they did not see me; I stood there with
my hands pressed against my throbbing temples, looking
on at what seemed to be a dream picture of something
that had happened years and years before&mdash;looking
on at myself, and seeming to live again my
own hopeless love story. For now I saw that the
boy held her close in his arms, and whispered to her;
and she seemed to be weeping.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I must have suddenly gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
mad, or that this was some dream out of which I should
presently wake. But while I stood there staring at
them, I went over in my mind all that I had done the
previous night and that day: my long walk from
London&mdash;and the coming into the old town at break of
day&mdash;then this further journey here. I looked down
at my shabby clothes, and stared in bewilderment at
my coarsened hands with the broken nails. Yes&mdash;I
was convict No. 145&mdash;once Charlie Avaline; and these
were no dream figures, but two people living out again,
in some strange fashion, the life that I had lived in a
few short hours with Barbara Patton. Yet here was
Barbara herself&mdash;with the eyes of my Barbara, and the
face of my Barbara&mdash;all unchanged, as I had dreamed
of her so often in my cell in prison! How was I to
account for that?</p>

<p>I remained hidden at no great distance from them;
I saw them presently part. The boy was impressing
something upon her; I saw her dry her tears, and
listen, and even strive to smile at something that he
said. Then they clung together for a moment or two&mdash;and
she ran away through the woods, waving her
hand to him as she went. He walked back dejectedly
to his easel, and packed up his things, and went away.
And I, in a fever of anxiety and remorse and wonder,
followed him.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strangest thing of all was to see him go
to that inn where I had once stayed&mdash;going into it with
the light step that I must have had twenty years before.
It was as though the ghost of myself had come back, in
a better shape than I, to take up the life I had dropped.</p>

<p>I watched him all that day; which is to say that I
hung about the little town, and waited for him, wondering
what he would do. I was not surprised when, as it
was growing dark, he came out into the High Street,
and set off at a swinging pace in the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
house I had known as belonging to old Patton. With
the trot that had been mine for so long in the exercise
ground of the prison, I went after him.</p>

<p>It was obvious that he was not so lucky as I had been,
in that he must not enter the house. I crept into the
grounds, and presently saw him standing on that very
terrace on which I had stood with my Barbara&mdash;looking
in at the windows and listening; I was below the
terrace, crouched among some bushes, watching him,
and watching the lighted windows. Presently a man
walked to one of them, and opened it a little way, and
returned into the room; and still I lay there, watching
and thinking and wondering.</p>

<p>Then across the silence of the night there broke the
sound of music, and the voice of a girl singing. I
dropped my head upon my arms as I lay there; it
seemed as though I could not bear it. For this was a
song I had heard twenty years before in that very room,
and it seemed to me that the voice was the same,
coming hauntingly and wonderfully out of the past.
The boy stood listening too; every word and every note
floated to us clearly. It seemed as though out of the
deep night of the years Barbara's voice came to me,
singing to me as she had sung before.</p>

<p>The song ceased, and the last notes died away. The
girl came to the open window, and looked out into
the night; I saw the boy crouching there, watching her.
Then from somewhere in the room a man's voice sounded
quite clearly and distinctly.</p>

<p>"Barbara, you have your mother's voice."</p>

<p>She turned her head, and looked back into the room.
"Thank you, father," she said; "I like to hear you
say that."</p>

<p>I lay still, with a full understanding coming to me
for the first time. This was not my Barbara; this
was her child. I had come back, to find the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
gone, and the child in her place&mdash;in her very likeness.
And I had come back, as it seemed, to touch again a
love story as hopeless and as broken as my own had
been. While the girl stood at the window, and the
boy crouched in the shadows watching her, I lay there&mdash;thinking&mdash;thinking!</p>

<p>Presently the window was fastened, and the shutters
drawn; lights began to appear in the upper windows.
The boy lingered for a long time, but presently stole
away; I crept after him. I did not know what to do,
or what to think; I was like a lost soul wandering the
earth, forlorn and hopeless and helpless. But he, going
on through the night back to his lodging, was so much
a part of myself, sprung up suddenly out of the past,
that I could not bear to lose sight of him; I was close
behind him when we came to the outskirts of the little
town. There he turned suddenly, and faced about,
looking at me.</p>

<p>"Why do you follow me?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I meant no harm," I replied. "I beg you won't
take any notice of me; I'm only a poor wanderer."</p>

<p>I saw his hand go to his pocket, as though he would
have given me money; I drew back hastily. "Not
that," I said; "I don't need that. But I was once like
you&mdash;God knows how many years ago!&mdash;and so I liked
to feel that I was near you. I'm sorry ... good-night!"</p>

<p>I went away quickly, leaving him staring after me.
Presently, when he had gone on again, I followed him,
at a greater distance; came to the inn where he was
stopping, and stood outside for a long time, wondering
passionately and despairingly if I could help him; and
then laughing at that thought, ruefully enough, when
I remembered my own forlorn condition.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of doing anything there, where I
was merely a penniless waif, was borne in upon me more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
forcefully the next day. I had found shelter in a
barn, and I begged my breakfast from a charitable
woman at a cottage. Then I set out again to walk to
London. It was only when I was many miles on my
journey that I stood still in the road, with a hand
pressed to my forehead, and with a new light breaking
in upon me.</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe had tried to tell me of this new
Barbara! Why had I forgotten that; why hadn't
I understood what he meant? Jervis Fanshawe had
told me that I should see my Barbara again, as I had
seen her in the past; that I should come back to love
and life and laughter. Jervis Fanshawe understood;
surely he would be able to show me what was best to
be done. I set off at a greater rate than ever for London,
determined that I must see him at the earliest
opportunity, and tell him the wonderful thing that I
had discovered.</p>

<p>I could think only of that discovery; I forgot completely
what the man was whose services I desired to
enlist&mdash;forgot all he had done, and all I had suffered
indirectly through him. I had no one in the world to
whom I could turn, save this man; and I only remembered
with gratitude then that he had come to me at
the moment of my release from prison, and had given
me food and lodging.</p>

<p>It was very late when I reached the shabby little
street in the neighbourhood of the river; I must have
found it by a sort of instinct, for I did not even know
its name. I came to the house, and rang the bell;
the child my guardian had called Moggs opened the
door. She grinned when she saw me, and jerked her
head towards the staircase.</p>

<p>"Lucky you've come," she said, in a sort of hoarse
whisper. "'E's bin carryin' on like mad, blamin' me
for it, of all fings. I made sure you'd cut yer lucky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>I guessed dimly that my guardian had wondered at
my absence; I went quickly up the stairs. I opened
the door, and went eagerly into the room, with my tale
at my very lips; but I stopped short when I saw that
another man was seated at the table from which
Fanshawe had risen.</p>

<p>"So you've come back, have you?" sneered my
guardian, looking me over with no very favourable
eye. "And by the look of you, I should think you've
been out of doors a little."</p>

<p>I became suddenly aware how deplorably muddy
and dirty I was. Like a scolded child, I pulled off
my hat, and stood there with bowed head, unable to
say a word. I raised my head when I heard the other
man speak to Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"Is this the fellow?"</p>

<p>It was a curiously hard voice, a cold metallic voice.
I looked at the speaker, and saw a man a little over
thirty years of age, with a strong, rather heavy face;
I noticed that his dark hair grew low on his forehead,
and rather forward at the temples. He was very well-dressed&mdash;so
well-dressed, in fact, that his being in that
place at all on friendly terms with the shabby Jervis
Fanshawe seemed incongruous in itself.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is the fellow," said Fanshawe, taking me
by the sleeve and drawing me forward. "You can
speak to him yourself."</p>

<p>The man lounging at the table looked up at me contemptuously
enough&mdash;studied me as he might have
studied a dog he meant to buy if he approved of it.</p>

<p>"You've been in prison?" he said at last.</p>

<p>I bowed my head, and dropped my eyes. "A long
time," I replied.</p>

<p>"And now are thrown on the world, with a living
to get if possible, and with no trade at your fingers'
ends&mdash;eh? Well, I may be able to help you. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
friends here, and so I can speak freely. You killed a
man?"</p>

<p>"A long time ago," I said, without raising my eyes.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be ashamed of," he retorted,
with a disagreeable laugh&mdash;"in fact, you're a man to
know. I've been talking to Fanshawe here about you,
and I think you may serve my purpose."</p>

<p>"In a word, Charlie," broke in Fanshawe excitedly,
"there's a chance for you to get back a little payment
for what you have suffered&mdash;to pay off old scores&mdash;to
get a little cheap revenge. Don't stare at me like that;
pull your wits together, and listen."</p>

<p>"To pay off old scores? Revenge?" I stared at
him, wondering if he knew what I had seen in that old
place of my dreams&mdash;wondering what he would say
next.</p>

<p>"You have served a long term of imprisonment&mdash;your
life has been broken and spoilt and ruined," went
on the man at the table, setting my guardian aside.
"Naturally you hate those who have drawn you into
that; naturally your mind is filled with the desire to
get even with them&mdash;to settle that old account."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," I murmured, looking from
one to the other.</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe seized my arm, and shook me
fiercely. "Years ago you suffered, like a fool, for the
sake of a woman; she cared nothing for you, and
married another man. Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Her name was Barbara," I replied slowly.</p>

<p>Fanshawe turned to the stranger. "You see he
remembers something," he said. Then he turned again
impatiently to me. "I have already told you that a
new Barbara has sprung up in her place&mdash;a child&mdash;a
girl."</p>

<p>Glancing at the face of the stranger at the table, I
decided to hide my knowledge of what I had seen; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
said nothing. Perhaps here I was to be shown the
way to do what was in my mind; perhaps I was to be
helped, as I had never expected to be helped at all.</p>

<p>"You understand, Avaline," went on the stranger,
in his deadly voice, "that I take an interest in this
new Barbara, who is like the Barbara you so mistakenly
loved twenty years ago. In other words, for her
own sake it is necessary that I should see much of her&mdash;communicate
with her often. That is difficult without
a third person, because the lady herself is a little obdurate.
Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, looking at him for a moment, and
then turning to my guardian. "I begin to understand."</p>

<p>"So that if I can introduce to her some one she
does not know&mdash;some one who is bound, by reasons of
policy, to do what he is told, without thought of the
consequences&mdash;I am a gainer," went on the man at
the table. "You have reason to hate a girl, so unfortunately
formed in the image of the woman who deceived
you, and brought disaster upon you; you have
reason to be loyal to me, because I can keep you from
starving, and can give you clothes and shelter. You're
a poor broken worn-out thing, and I take pity on you.
Now do you understand the situation?"</p>

<p>I understood it so well that my mind, for the first
time since I had stepped out from the prison gates,
was clear, and I was fully alive. I looked eagerly
from one to the other; I told the man brokenly that
I would do all he asked; I think I suggested that I
would be his slave. He might tell me to do anything;
I was eager to take up that old story that I had been
compelled to lay down.</p>

<p>"For your revenge?" he asked, with a grin.</p>

<p>"For my revenge!" I said; and burst into a shout
of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of him," I heard my guardian
whisper. "The poor fool is only half-witted; his
years of prison life have told upon him. But he's
the man you want!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

<a name="I_ENTER_UPON_SERVITUDE" id="I_ENTER_UPON_SERVITUDE">I ENTER UPON SERVITUDE</a></h3>


<p>While I stood in the room watching the two
men, and eager to know what work was to
be given me to do that would enable me to touch again
the life I had left, Fanshawe and the stranger discussed
me in low voices, as they might have discussed some
piece of furniture they contemplated putting in some
particular place. I caught one or two of their remarks;
I listened with the humility that years had bred in
me to what they said of me.</p>

<p>"You can kick or bully him into anything," I heard
Fanshawe say, as he looked over his shoulder at me
contemptuously. "For the sake of his bread and
butter he'll do what he's told, and he'll do it humbly.
If any feeling of revenge is left in him, it will act as a
spur; but I don't think the spur will be needed. If he
gets troublesome, you can always kick him into the
road; he'll crawl back to you, and lick your hand,
like the shabby dog he is."</p>

<p>"We must give him a name," said the stranger,
looking at me with a thoughtful frown. "We can't
send him among those people with his old label attached
to him."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;you won't do that," I pleaded; for the
thought of that had not occurred to me before. "Give
me any name you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, we won't shame you, Mr. Charles Avaline,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
sneered Fanshawe; "you needn't be afraid of that.
What name would you like?"</p>

<p>"What were you in prison&mdash;I mean, what work did
you do?" demanded the other suddenly.</p>

<p>"I worked in the tinsmith's shop for the most part,"
I said. "They told me I made a good workman; they
showed my work to visitors sometimes; and then they
would call my number&mdash;145 was my number&mdash;and
point me out, and whisper."</p>

<p>"That will do as well as anything else," said the
other man, who was evidently paying no attention to
my remarks. "We'll christen you 'Tinman'; that
shall be your name from this time forward. See that
you answer to it." He got up and sauntered to the
door, with a careless nod to Jervis Fanshawe; stopped
there, and turned round, slapping the side of his leg
with a light cane he carried. I remember that he reminded
me in a strange haunting fashion of another
man I had seen, who had stood with his arms akimbo,
and with a light cane resting on one hip and under his
hand.</p>

<p>"And by the way, Tinman, you'd better know your
new master's name. I am Murray Olivant; keep that
name in your mind, because you'll have to remember it.
Fanshawe will tell you what to do, and when I want
you."</p>

<p>He sauntered out of the room, banging the door
behind him. Jervis Fanshawe turned to me, rubbing
his lean hands together, and grinning delightedly.</p>

<p>"Now, Charlie, perhaps you'll know in future who
your best friend is," he said. "This is only the beginning;
it all rests in your hands to make the most
of this opportunity, for both our sakes. Olivant's
rich&mdash;very rich indeed; it'll go hard with us if we
don't dip our fingers into his pockets more deeply than
he suspects. Jail-birds both, Charlie," he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
tapping me on the breast with his lean forefinger; "it
won't do for us to have any scruples, will it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," I answered him. "But what will
he want me to do. Be patient with me," I pleaded,
"because I'm not used to the ways of the world yet;
I'm afraid of everything. Be patient with me."</p>

<p>"I'll be patient with you, dolt!" he exclaimed
wrathfully. "In the first place, I suppose you understand
that our friend Mr. Murray Olivant happens to
take a very deep interest in matters in which you
and I once interested ourselves, but with which we
now have nothing further to do. In other words, as
I have explained to you partly already, there is a new
generation grown up in the place you knew; and our
friend Olivant knows that generation well. More than
that, he knows one at least of the old generation."</p>

<p>I knew to what he referred; I remembered the new
Barbara I had seen&mdash;so like her mother, and so unconsciously
living again, as it seemed, her mother's story.
It was so clear to me now that I was almost prepared
for the next words Fanshawe said, and they did not
come upon me with any real shock.</p>

<p>"And the new generation that is growing up is
rather like what the old one was, and is represented by
a girl. They call her Barbara. That makes you
jump&mdash;eh?" he demanded vindictively. "And our
friend Murray Olivant takes a deep interest in this
Barbara&mdash;in other words&mdash;loves her."</p>

<p>It was all coming true&mdash;it was all happening as I
knew instinctively in my own mind it must happen.
Fate was marching on grimly enough, and I saw that
not only was there a new Barbara and a new Charlie
Avaline, but that here, menacing them, was a new
Gavin Hockley. I was afraid, and I suppose the
terror that was growing up in me showed itself in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
face. At all events my guardian saw it, but mistook
the reason for it.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for you to be frightened about,"
he said scornfully; "I don't suppose any one is likely
to recognize you. You'll only be poor Tinman, the
hanger-on and servant; no one is likely to ask questions
about you. I don't doubt Murray Olivant will
give you plenty of dirty work to do; and you must do
it with a smiling face, and be thankful that you've
found some one to keep you out of the workhouse.
By the way," he added suddenly, as the thought
occurred to him&mdash;"where have you been last night and
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just wandering about," I replied vaguely;
for I did not mean to tell him that I had taken that
surprising plunge back into the past. "I have not
seen London for so long," I added lamely.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right; but don't try that game
again," he said. "You'll be landing some of us into
difficulties, to say nothing of yourself, if you wander
about in your present muddle-headed condition. Stay
where you can be looked after, and do as you're told."</p>

<p>I meekly promised that I would obey; I ventured
presently, as we sat there with the table between us,
to put a question or two about the past.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me," I said&mdash;"I want to know
what has happened down at Hammerstone Market in
all these years. You tell me that a new Barbara has
grown up to take the place of the old, but what of
the old one?" It was all absurd and impossible,
and I was a poor shabby broken grey-haired man, to
whom love should mean nothing; but my voice trembled
as I asked the question.</p>

<p>"Your old flame?" he sneered. "Dead these many
years."</p>

<p>"Dead!" I sprang to my feet and stared at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
wildly; I remember that he hurriedly pushed his chair
back as though to avoid me. "Dead!"</p>

<p>"What is there to get excited about?" he cried.
"She couldn't live for ever&mdash;and besides, she treated
you none too well."</p>

<p>"Dead!" I said again, for that thought had never
occurred to me before. I had seen her always young
and fresh and unchanged; the curious thing was that
I seemed to see her so still, even though this other
girl had grown up in her image.</p>

<p>"And the new Barbara&mdash;the bit of a girl that our
friend Murray Olivant is so interested in&mdash;is like the
old Barbara come to life again," said Jervis Fanshawe,
speaking as if to himself, and with his lips set in a
straight bitter line. "I hate her!&mdash;I loathe the sight
of her. She stands there"&mdash;in his excitement he had
risen to his feet, and had flung one thin arm above his
head&mdash;"with the same devilish childish beauty her
mother had&mdash;that mother that laughed at me, and
sent you to rot for twenty years in a prison. I tell
you, Charlie"&mdash;he dropped into his chair again and
leaned across the table, staring at me with wild eyes&mdash;"I
tell you that I have lain behind a hedge down in
that place where she lives&mdash;so close to her that I could
have risen up and seized her, and crushed the life out
of her before she could cry out. Yes&mdash;and with these
hands!"</p>

<p>"She never harmed you," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"No, but she lives in the image of the woman who
laughed at me, and set me aside as something not to
be reckoned with. And I've waited, Charlie&mdash;by
God!&mdash;I've waited!"</p>

<p>I did not guess then what was in his mind; I did
not realize that the deadly hatred of the man for the
one woman he had failed to possess could pass on
through all those years, and grow again, stronger for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the waiting, and rise up stark and strong against the
child. I had not understood that any man could live
for that and that only; could wait in the snow outside
my prison to seize me as an instrument ready to his
hand. I did not even then understand the man.</p>

<p>"The Barbara who died&mdash;the Barbara I loved," I
said gently&mdash;"won't you tell me about her?"</p>

<p>"She died at sea," he replied. "Her child had been
born, and they said that the mother was not strong;
that she had never been the same woman after her
marriage. Perhaps she fretted after you"&mdash;this with
a grin and a kick at me under the table that was meant
to be facetious. "At all events, the husband was
persuaded to take her on a sea voyage, and the child
went with them. She fell into a sort of fever&mdash;the
mother, I mean&mdash;and they had to watch her constantly,
because it almost seemed that she would take
her own life. Then one day her cabin was found to
be empty; the ship was searched; but she was gone.
A little later the husband found a note written by
her; she had made up her mind to end her life, and
was only watching for an opportunity to throw herself
overboard. She commended the child to his care.
And that was the end of her."</p>

<p>Barbara dead! It did not seem possible to my
mind, even then when I had chapter and verse for it;
I could not set aside that vision I had always had of
her&mdash;as the bright young girl who had met me in the
wood twenty years before. I realized bitterly enough
that in that, as in all other things, I had been tricked;
that while I dreamed of her in my prison cell, and
hugged that dear remembrance to myself, she had
been in the depths of the sea, dead and forgotten.
I woke now to the consciousness that the cruel voice
of Jervis Fanshawe was still talking to me.</p>

<p>"As for the father&mdash;Lucas Savell&mdash;he has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
a thing of no account. When old Patton died he left
the business to Savell&mdash;principally, I think, for the
sake of the child; and Savell has let it go to rack
and ruin. He was a poor creature always&mdash;and I think
the loss of Barbara finished him. At any rate, he has
gone down and down, and they say he drinks. So far
as the business is concerned"&mdash;Fanshawe shrugged
his shoulders and laughed&mdash;"well&mdash;that's where
Murray Olivant comes in."</p>

<p>"In what way?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a keen blade, is Olivant," said Fanshawe,
shaking his head at an imaginary Murray Olivant, and
chuckling. "He's always had money&mdash;and he always
will have it; he's like a bird of prey, ready to stick
his talons into the choicest morsels he sees round him.
He saw Lucas Savell and the business; he advanced
money; and so got a hold here and a hold there, until
at last the thing was his. It is supposed to belong to
Savell&mdash;but he dare not call his soul his own. You
needn't look surprised; it has all been a process of
years, so gradual that others have not noticed it.
Lucas Savell is like a sucked orange, and can be cast
aside at any moment."</p>

<p>"Why do you hate them so&mdash;I mean, apart from
Barbara?" I asked.</p>

<p>Always it seemed that when his supposed wrongs
were referred to a sort of semi-madness came upon
Jervis Fanshawe, so that he lost control of himself,
and was at first unable to speak. Such a madness
was upon him now; he had to gasp and open his lips
once or twice, and to stretch out a hand towards me,
and even clutch at his throat a little before he was
able to speak at all. And when he did at last, his
voice was hoarse and unnatural with excitement.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they ruined me; they stood me in the
dock on charges of forgery and fraud; they forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
all my years of service. I had had to get the money
from somewhere to satisfy that beast Hockley; I got
it from them, meaning to pay it back when the luck
changed. It never did change, and Hockley's death
finished me. Then, when I came out of prison, old
Patton was dead and Savell was established. And I
found another man taking my revenge from me, and
robbing Savell, and draining him dry. And I wormed
myself in with that man, and made myself useful to
him&mdash;just as you will do, Charlie&mdash;just as you're going
to do from to-night. He's a fine fellow, this Murray
Olivant; he'll break them up, and make a beggar of
Savell&mdash;and he'll get the girl. Think of that, Charlie;
the Barbara for whom you've worn out your heart
and your life in prison is dead, and the new Barbara
shall be at the beck and call of this man&mdash;who won't
treat her any too well, I'll warrant. There's a revenge
for you!"</p>

<p>I was afraid to ask any direct question as to the
boy I had seen with this new Barbara in the wood;
I feared that Fanshawe must know at once if I did that
I had been down to spy out the land. But I asked,
a little wistfully perhaps, a question that artfully concealed
what I already knew.</p>

<p>"Is it not possible that this girl&mdash;this other Barbara&mdash;loves
some one else?"</p>

<p>"And what if she does?" he snapped at me;
"they've all got fads and fancies, and so much the
worse for them. This little fool, for instance, believes
herself to be in love with a boy who hasn't a penny&mdash;just
such a young jackanapes as you were twenty
years ago. In fact, he paints, as you tried to do.
He's a starveling dog&mdash;just as you were."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He's half-brother to our friend Olivant, whose
mother married again, and died when she gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
boy to the world. They call him Arnold Millard, and
he's dependent on his half-brother for the clothes he
wears and the food he eats. And yet, forsooth, has
the cheek to step in and pretend to be in love with the
girl destined for the other man."</p>

<p>"But her father&mdash;Lucas Savell&mdash;what does he
say?"</p>

<p>"He dare not say anything; it's not in his hands.
Our friend Olivant can turn him out neck and crop
at a moment's notice, and he knows it. Oh, I can
tell you Murray Olivant's a man to be looked up to;
he rules every one and everything. Keep in his good
books, Charlie, and you'll never starve; but you
mustn't offend him. I don't know what would have
become of me," he added plaintively, "if I hadn't
happened to stumble across him. True, I've done
some shady things for him; but he's been very good
to me."</p>

<p>I remember that I strove hard for the next day or
two, while I awaited orders from my new master, to
thrash out in my mind the complicated thing that
was before me, that I might work out the pitiful story
to the advantage of those in whom I was so passionately
interested. For, think of my position! It was
my fate to see again two helpless beings striving hard
to work out their love story, just as I had striven
with Barbara in the old days, and beset on all hands
by enemies. This Barbara, who had risen, as it were,
from the ashes of her dead mother to take up the burden
that mother had laid down, was alone in the world,
save for the helpless boy who loved her; and I knew
inevitably that stronger forces than any she could
combat would bear upon them and drive them asunder.
That was inevitable, unless I could do something to
help them; and I was an old and broken man, degraded
and useless, with my soul stained with murder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and with the record of twenty wasted years behind
me. I was in despair when I thought about it; it
seemed impossible that I could do anything.</p>

<p>Two days later I was told by Jervis Fanshawe that
he had received a message from Olivant saying that I
was to present myself to that gentleman at once, and
take my orders. The better to be sure of me, Fanshawe
went with me; he took me to a great house
in a fashionable quarter of the town, where I found
that Murray Olivant lived in great style in a beautifully
furnished flat, with a highly respectable manservant
to attend upon him. I know that the man looked at
me contemptuously enough as he left us in the hall
of the place; my guardian he seemed to know, and
told him that Mr. Olivant would see him at once. I
was left standing in the hall, when presently Fanshawe
was conducted into the presence of his patron; they
kept me waiting quite a long time before the manservant
appeared again, after a bell had been rung, and told
me I was wanted.</p>

<p>"You're to go in there," said the man, jerking his
head towards a door at the other side of the hall.</p>

<p>I went in, and found Murray Olivant lounging in a
deep chair before the fire; Jervis Fanshawe stood at
a little distance from him, a shabby figure indeed in
contrast to the other man. Olivant was smoking a
big cigar, which he was nervously turning over and over
between his teeth, the while he frowned at me through
the smoke. I did not speak; I waited again while
they discussed what was to be done with me, in that
fashion they had used before, quite as though I were
a piece of furniture that had been purchased, and for
which a place had to be found.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get him some clothes&mdash;something
dark and respectable," said Olivant. "Get them to-day;
he must go down to Hammerstone Market to-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
taking my luggage. Also he'll take a letter
from me to Savell; I shall follow to-morrow. Does
he remember where the place is, do you think? You
Tinman," he called to me; "do you know where
Hammerstone Market is?"</p>

<p>"I remember it, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"You'll have enough money given you to take you
down there; you will remember that you are Tinman,
my personal servant. You'll have no difficulty about
it; they'll put you up at the house. Fanshawe will
take you out now, and rig you up properly; you'll be
back here by six o'clock. Your train leaves at a few
minutes to seven." He turned to Jervis Fanshawe,
and spoke impatiently. "Do you think the idiot
understands?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," was the reply. "You don't want him
too sharp, you know."</p>

<p>"You're doing splendidly," said Fanshawe, when
we were outside the place again. "I can see that
you'll be just the very man to do the work he wants;
you'll play the dumb dog, and do what you're told,
and ask no questions, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I replied; but I think he was a little
disappointed that I should appear to take so little
interest in this new life that was being mapped out
for me.</p>

<p>Some clothing was bought for me at a second-hand
dealer's, and I was rigged out cheaply to fit my new
position. I did not see Murray Olivant when I went
back to his rooms; his manservant pointed to the
luggage that had been packed, and gave me a letter
addressed to Lucas Savell, and some money. At the
last moment before opening the door the man plucked
me by the sleeve, and drew me back, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, who are you? and what are you supposed
to be? Hang me if I can make you out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't necessary," I replied; "I don't know
myself." I went out of the place, carrying some of
the luggage, and leaving him to follow with the rest.</p>

<p>A cab was called, and I started; my last vision of
the servant was seeing him standing on the pavement
outside the house, scratching his chin and staring perplexedly
after me. But, in my deeper anxiety as to
what was going to happen to me in that strange house
at Hammerstone Market, I forgot his very existence
by the time the cab had turned the corner.</p>

<p>I reached Hammerstone Market without adventure,
took a fly from the station, and drove to the house.
Darkness had long since set in, and I could see nothing
of the grounds when presently the vehicle turned in at
the gates; I could only judge, by the sound of the
churning wheels, that we were driving through masses
of dead leaves that must have lain there for many
past years. Coming to the house at last, I was deposited
with the luggage outside the door, and the fly
drove away. I stood there in the darkness, hearing a
great bell clang somewhere in the distance, and wondering
what would be said to me when the door should
presently open.</p>

<p>I had no fear that any one would recognize me;
the mere thought of that was absurd. Indeed, there
was but one disturbing thought in my mind&mdash;the fear
of meeting the new Barbara, and so of coming face to
face with that figure, cut, as it were, out of the life I
had once lived in that very place; I feared I should
not be able to trust myself or my voice at that time.
For the rest, I only knew dimly that I should probably
have to see much that might goad me almost to madness,
and yet that I must say nothing; I was in a
sense fumbling in the dark, with only my memories to
guide me.</p>

<p>The door was opened at last, and I stepped, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
were, straight back into that night when I had first
come to this house with my guardian&mdash;twenty years
before. Nothing was changed, save only that everything
seemed to have dwindled in the years, and
that the furniture was shabbier and meaner looking.
I felt my heart beating fast as I looked towards that
broad staircase down which I had once seen the
Barbara who was dead coming, with tears in her
eyes, and with her laughing bridesmaids surrounding
her. It seemed almost as though she might at any
moment turn the corner of the staircase, and come
down towards me.</p>

<p>An elderly woman in a dingy black dress took my
letter, and bade me stay where I was. She appeared
to be a servant; and I watched her as she climbed the
stairs slowly, and went away, leaving me standing in
the hall. I was looking about me when I heard above
a quick, light footstep; looking up, I saw Barbara
coming down the stairs, with one hand lightly resting
on the rail, and with her eyes turned straight towards
me. I stood there watching her; I wondered vaguely
what she would have thought had she known who I
was, and under what circumstances I had last stood in
that place, twenty years before.</p>

<p>When she came up to me she spoke with her mother's
tongue, and with a little quick smile that had belonged
to the dead woman. "My father sent me to you; he
is not&mdash;not very well to-night. He understands, of
course, that Mr. Olivant is coming down"&mdash;the smile
died from her lips, and she seemed to draw herself up
a little stiffly&mdash;"everything shall be got ready for him.
You are strange here; you won't know your room.
Your name is Tinman?"</p>

<p>I acknowledged the ridiculous title, and at her suggestion
carried the luggage up into a room that was
evidently to be prepared for Murray Olivant; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a large room on the first floor. My own was at the
top of the house&mdash;a little meagre room, with odds and
ends of furniture in it. I saw that she was looking
at me curiously as I stood in this little room; I had a
dreadful fear for the moment&mdash;ridiculous though it
was&mdash;that she must know my real name.</p>

<p>"I have given you a lot of trouble, miss," I said, for
the want of something better to say.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Oh, I don't mind," she
replied. "You see, in these days, Tinman, we have
no servants&mdash;at least, only the woman you saw, and a
young girl. Not that it matters much, because there
is only my father and myself. He wants to see you;
will you come down, please?"</p>

<p>I was following her down the half-lighted staircase
in that silent house when she turned suddenly, and
waited for me; dropped her hand on my arm, and
spoke in a whisper. "Have you ever seen ghosts,
Tinman?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I faltered, staring at her, and beginning to
shake.</p>

<p>"There are ghosts in this house," she whispered,
glancing about her quickly. "I hear them rustling
on the stairs, and in the old rooms that are shut up,
and at night among the trees. You needn't be
afraid; they're nothing to do with you."</p>

<p>There were ghosts enough for me in that place,
Heaven knows; they were everywhere about me that
night. For I was a boy again, dreaming the hopeless
dreams of the past, and seeing everywhere the Barbara
I had lost in this Barbara of the silent house. I found
that Lucas Savell had lost his good-humoured look,
and carried a face of fretful melancholy; his hands
shook and trembled as he stood looking at me, and
holding the letter I had brought.</p>

<p>"Mr. Murray Olivant gives his orders&mdash;and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
obey," he said bitterly, as the letter crackled in his
fingers. "We make welcome those he brings or sends
to us; we have no choice in the matter." Then, as
Barbara laid a light hand on his, he seemed to recollect
the part he had to play, and smiled and nodded, and
changed his tone. "Of course, he's always welcome&mdash;and
any one he sends is sure of a welcome,"
he said. "He comes to-morrow? I'm glad&mdash;very
glad."</p>

<p>I was left to my own devices that night, after I had
had a meal that was provided for me by the woman
who had first admitted me to the house. She was a
morose, sullen sort of creature, and she asked no questions
and gave me no information. As soon as I
could escape I went out into the grounds, and walked
about there for a time in the long-neglected paths, and
on the terrace where long ago I had stood with Barbara
on the night she bade me farewell. And presently
from the lighted room within the sound of music came,
and the new Barbara's voice floated out to me.</p>

<p>I was standing there listening, when I became suddenly
alive to the fact that I was not alone on the terrace.
I had been standing with half-closed eyes, drinking
in the melody, when I became aware that out of the
shadows of the garden one shadow had detached itself,
and was creeping noiselessly towards the lighted
windows. At first the thing was so impalpable, and
was, moreover, so unlikely, that I took no notice of
it; but presently it stopped just beyond the broad
track of light from the windows, and I saw that it
was a woman, dressed in black. In that neglected
place, and outside that house of ghosts, it was so strange
that I felt my hair rise, and a curious tingling sensation
in my throat. And for a long time, as it seemed,
I remained staring at it, until, just as I was gaining
courage to move towards it, I found that it had melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
into the other shadows of the garden, and was gone.
My courage had returned by that time, and I went
quickly after it; but, though I looked in all directions,
I saw nothing.</p>

<p>I went back to the house, and entered just in time
to see Barbara crossing the hall with a tray in her
hands, on which was a decanter and a glass; some
old instinct made me step forward to relieve her of
it; she smiled, and shook her head, but I persisted,
and took the tray from her.</p>

<p>"It's very good of you, Tinman," she said; "it's
for my father."</p>

<p>I carried the tray into that room that overlooked
the terrace, and set it down at Lucas Savell's elbow.
He stared at me in surprise for a moment, but said
nothing; his daughter, coming after me, asked that
I would draw the curtains; I had a pleasant feeling
for a moment that she liked to have me there. I
moved across to the windows, to fasten the shutters
before drawing the curtains; and as I did so glanced
back for a moment over my shoulder at her. She
was bending over her father, with an arm about his
shoulders; she seemed to be pleading with him, and
he petulantly setting her aside.</p>

<p>I turned quickly to the window, with the shutter
in my hand, and was confronted with a face, staring
in. I was so astounded for a moment that I stood
there, staring in turn; my eyes seemed to hold the
eyes in the white face outside. Then, as I gave a
sort of frightened cry, the face was gone, so suddenly
that I might never have seen it at all. I fumbled with
the window, and got it open, and stepped out on to
the terrace. There was no one there.</p>

<p>"Did you speak, Tinman?" asked the girl; and
then, as I did not reply, she came near to me. "What's
the matter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought&mdash;thought I saw some one&mdash;something,"
I replied blunderingly.</p>

<p>She laughed as she helped me with the shutters.</p>

<p>"You're seeing the ghosts, Tinman," she whispered.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<a name="THE_COMING_OF_THE_WOLVES" id="THE_COMING_OF_THE_WOLVES">THE COMING OF THE WOLVES</a></h3>


<p>I slept but badly that night; it seemed so strange
that I should be under that roof in these days
of ruin and disaster&mdash;hiding, as it were, from the
sight of men, and striving to plot, in my own feeble
futile way, against forces that must in time inevitably
overwhelm and sweep me away. I had been a poor
prisoner for so many years; I was like a child in the
world now, with whatever powers I had once had
dulled and blunted. Passionately I desired to help
this girl, who already smiled at me with the eyes of
her dead mother, and whose speaking of that absurd
name of mine&mdash;Tinman&mdash;was like a caress. Yet what
could I do?&mdash;how could I help her or the boy she
loved?</p>

<p>I thought, too, more than once of that shadowy
figure I had seen on the terrace, hovering like a lost
soul outside the house&mdash;of that face that had stared
in at me from the darkness outside into the room
where the father and daughter were. Unless by any
chance I had been deceived, who was this woman who
moved silently about the grounds at night, and what
was her interest in the girl? I tried to dismiss from
my mind the whole thing as a mere hallucination&mdash;a
something bred of all the dreams that once had been
mine in that house; but I could not shut out that
face that had stared in at me. I remembered how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
eyes had held mine for one long moment before I
cried out; I remembered in a puzzled way that there
had been something curiously familiar about them&mdash;as
though that figure, too, had come out of the dreams
of the past to haunt me. I remembered what the
girl had said on the staircase about the ghosts in the
great dreary house; I found myself sitting up in bed
in the dark room, with my hands clasped round my
knees, thinking about it all, and asking myself over
and over again what I should do. Almost I wished
myself back in my cell in prison, with the certain
knowledge upon me that nothing could ever disturb
me there, and that the world outside was dead. I
hated the thought that I had been dragged out again
into such a tangle as this.</p>

<p>Better resolves came with the morning; the wintry
sunlight seemed to warm me, and to warm any faint
resolution that was beginning to shape itself in my
mind. I would be strong and watchful; I held a
power here that no one suspected, because I knew
so much, and had loved so strongly, and was, after
all, only a poor creature with whom fate had done
its worst and could do no more. Yes&mdash;I would be
strong.</p>

<p>There was, of course, nothing for me to do, save to
kill time; I was allowed to wander about as I liked.
Yet there was in me an insane desire to see the girl&mdash;to
watch this new Barbara that was to me the old Barbara
come alive again. I hung about, foolishly enough,
on the chance of seeing her&mdash;watched her when presently
she went out of the house and started for a walk.
She was so much to me, and I desired so strongly to
watch over her, that I found myself following, perhaps
with the fear that some harm might come to her, and
that I might be able to prevent it.</p>

<p>I had meant, of course, to keep out of her way; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
had not intended that she should see me. But as I
was going on eagerly to turn the corner of a wall round
which she had gone, I came face to face with her;
she was turning back, and so had met me. I stood
shamed and foolish before her.</p>

<p>"Tinman! Were you following me?"</p>

<p>I could not lie to her; I raised my eyes pleadingly
to hers, and stammered that I had followed her from
the house.</p>

<p>"But why? Were you spying upon me?" She
drew herself up, and looked at me scornfully; I
trembled before her like a beaten dog. "I should
have remembered that you are the servant of that
man," she said.</p>

<p>I had almost flung myself at her feet; I know that
I stretched out my hands to her, and clasped them in
my frantic eagerness to make her understand. "Don't
think that&mdash;don't believe it!" I exclaimed. "You
don't understand&mdash;and I may not tell you; but I am
your friend. If I could tell you what is in this poor
bruised and broken heart of mine, you would understand,
and would pity me and trust me. I am your
friend&mdash;and his."</p>

<p>"His?" She looked at me with a sudden frown
of astonishment.</p>

<p>"The boy you love&mdash;the boy who meets you sometimes
in secret&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you have been spying, then!" she cried,
drawing away from me.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no; indeed I have not. It was by the
merest accident I saw you meet him in the woods,
and no living soul knows of that but myself. If I
could only make you trust me!"</p>

<p>She came nearer to me&mdash;looked at me closely.
"Who are you, or what were you?" she asked in a
whisper. "You are no servant; you speak like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
gentleman. Who are you&mdash;and what have you to do
with me, or&mdash;or with any one else that concerns
me?"</p>

<p>"I am one who died long, long ago," I said to her.
"If you think of me at all, think of me as some one
who long ago touched such a story as yours&mdash;such a
story of love and hope and faith, all broken and cast
in the dust. Think of me as some one who loved&mdash;and
lost what I loved; think of me as some one who,
seeing you as young and fair and bright as the woman
I loved, would give the very heart out of me to see you
happy. As God's above me, I'm your friend!"</p>

<p>She looked at me in wonder, but I saw that she
believed me; I think she was half inclined for a moment
to confide in me. If she had done so then, much of
the horror and tragedy and despair that were to come
upon us both and upon others might have been averted.
But I suppose she remembered that I was only
Tinman, the servant of the man who had that power
over her father and herself; she shook her head perplexedly,
and turned away.</p>

<p>"You must not follow me," she said.</p>

<p>"I will not again," I assured her. "But you are
the only creature on earth that has spoken gently to
me for many, many years; I only followed you as a
dog might do, to see that you were safe. Besides,
you look at me out of the eyes of a woman I loved&mdash;a
woman who is dead."</p>

<p>I turned, and went away quickly on the road back
to the house. In a moment I heard her calling after
me, and I turned about and faced her. "Indeed, I
do trust you," she whispered, "and I know that you
are my friend. Some day you may have a chance to
prove that," she added.</p>

<p>"I pray God the time may come soon," I answered
fervently, as I took her little hands in my rough ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and raised them to my lips. It was as though I stood
again on that terrace outside the house&mdash;a boy of
twenty&mdash;and bowed my head over the hands of the
woman I loved.</p>

<p>I got back to the house in time to see the boy of
whom I had been speaking striding towards it. He
was but a little in advance of me, and he turned his
head sharply on hearing my feet crushing the dead
leaves; then waited for me to come up to him. When
I reached him he looked me over quickly; I remember
that I longed to tell him where Barbara had gone,
that he might run to overtake her. But I felt that
I had plunged far enough into the story for one
day.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen your face before," he said, not
ungently. "Do you belong here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;for the present," I replied. "My name
is Tinman; I am Mr. Olivant's servant."</p>

<p>He looked at me frowningly for a moment, as we
stood together watching each other. "Is my brother
here&mdash;Mr. Olivant, I mean?"</p>

<p>"He comes to-day, sir, I believe," I replied.</p>

<p>As if in confirmation of my words, I heard the sound
of wheels at that moment, and stepped back with
young Millard as the fly from the station drove past
us towards the house. Murray Olivant was in it; he
turned for a moment, and waved a hand towards the
young man; me he regarded with a scowl. Arnold
Millard walked on quickly after the vehicle, and I
followed. The boy was younger and quicker than I
was, and he reached the house some few moments
before I did. When I got to the door and passed into
the hall I saw the pair of them talking&mdash;Olivant seated,
with his hat on the back of his head, on an oak chest,
with his long legs stretched out before him, and the
boy facing him. I was obliged to pass them to go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the house; I was slipping past when Olivant called
to me.</p>

<p>"Tinman, I want you." He turned to his brother,
and spoke insolently enough. "That's the last word
I have to say about the matter; I can't do anything
for you at the moment. You shall have your money
all in good time, but you mustn't be so deuced sudden
about it. Where are you staying? I didn't know
you were down here at all."</p>

<p>"I'm staying at the <i>George</i>," said the boy.
"But I tell you, you must let me have some money to
go on with; I'm nearly penniless. And, after all,
Murray, it isn't as if it were your money; you're only
holding it for me."</p>

<p>"I know that; I don't need reminding of my responsibilities,"
retorted the other. "I can't talk about
it now," he added, getting up as though to put an
end to the conversation. "Come up here to-night&mdash;dine
here, if you like&mdash;and I'll tell you what I'm prepared
to do. I can't say more than that. Will you
come?"</p>

<p>The boy's face had flushed darkly red; there was a
pleased look in his eyes. "Of course I'll come, Murray&mdash;if
Mr. Savell will have me," he replied eagerly.</p>

<p>Murray Olivant laughed. "Oh, it's nothing to do
with Mr. Savell; I do as I like in this house. Dinner
at eight; we'll talk business afterwards. Now, Tinman,
just come and attend to me, will you?"</p>

<p>He strode away up the stairs, and I meekly followed
him; it did not seem at all necessary that he should
be announced in that house as having arrived. He
curtly told me to unpack his things; cursed me a
little because I had forgotten that important duty
before. While I unstrapped the luggage, and knelt
beside it to take the things out, he seated himself in an
easy-chair, and watched me, and asked questions. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
seemed to be in a good temper, and inclined to be indulgent
with me.</p>

<p>"Well, my faithful one, and how do you like coming
back among the ghosts?" he asked. Then, as I
glanced up at him with what I suppose was a scared
look in my eyes, he went on gaily: "There&mdash;there&mdash;you
needn't look so frightened; I won't give the game
away. But tell me&mdash;what do you think of the place&mdash;and
the people?&mdash;how do you like it all?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet had time to notice anything," I
said, without looking up.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; you can't fool me in that fashion.
You've been keenly watching everything&mdash;eager to
find out all you can. What of Savell?"</p>

<p>"He seems much broken and changed," I replied
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Bah!&mdash;he's a fool&mdash;and a whining fool at that,"
he exclaimed violently. "He's no good to himself
or any one else; he muddles himself with drink night
after night; one of these days he'll go off suddenly&mdash;snuffed
out like a candle in a draught. What of the
others?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;others?" I looked up at him stupidly.</p>

<p>"Well, the <i>other</i>, if you like," he retorted. "The
child&mdash;Barbara. What of her?"</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful&mdash;and very sweet&mdash;and
kind," I faltered, bending low over my work.</p>

<p>"Kind, is she?" he said, with a laugh. "So
you've begun already to screw your way into her good
graces, have you? That's right, Tinman; that's
what you're down here for, you old rascal. Watch all
she does&mdash;follow her about&mdash;pounce on any letters
that may chance to come for her, and let me see them
first. Spy on her, you dog&mdash;find out all about her."</p>

<p>I did not answer; I was glad to think that this
brute could have so little knowledge of me as to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that I should do it. He was evidently satisfied
with my silence; after a moment or two he went on
talking again.</p>

<p>"You're going to see company, Tinman. I've got
a friend coming down here to stay&mdash;man named Dawkins.
He's a sly devil, and I may want him; incidentally,
you can watch him too. Fanshawe also is
coming."</p>

<p>"Jervis Fanshawe?" I looked up at him quickly in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not here. He'll lie low in the town;
I'm going to get a lodging for him. Stirring times,
Tinman&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>He got up, and strode about the room, rubbing his
hands and laughing; I did not dare ask what was
going to happen. Presently he stopped, and faced
me as I knelt beside a portmanteau. "Look up at me,
Tinman, and speak the truth, if you can. You saw
that young man downstairs just now?"</p>

<p>I nodded slowly. "I saw him coming up to the
house," I replied truthfully; "he asked who I was,
and whether you had arrived."</p>

<p>"Ever seen him before?" he demanded. "Look
up at me; I want no lies."</p>

<p>I looked up at him, but I lied nevertheless. "Never,"
I replied steadily.</p>

<p>"The young fool thinks he's in love with the girl,
and believes that she's in love with him. It's all right
while he <i>thinks</i> so; but I don't mean to have any
nonsense. He's another one to be watched, Tinman;
if by any chance you should discover them meeting,
or whispering together, or any such nonsense as that&mdash;let
me know. Do you hear?" He kicked me
softly on the leg as he asked the question.</p>

<p>"I hear," I replied.</p>

<p>"Very well then&mdash;see that you do it. And don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
forget, at all times when you may be tempted to do
anything against my interests, that I've taken you
out of the gutter, and that I'll kick you back there
again, to starve, if you don't behave yourself. I don't
do dirty work myself; I employ men like you to do it
for me. Understand that?" He kicked me softly
again, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," I replied.</p>

<p>"Good. See that you remember it," he retorted.
"Understand also that in this house I do as I like,
and that my word is law. Above all things, be meek
and humble with me, Tinman; I want no fiery words
or looks from you. Your fiery youth is gone past,
and is done with."</p>

<p>"I know that," I said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yet you killed a man once, Tinman, so I've been
told," he added musingly. "It doesn't seem possible,
when one looks at you now, that you had hot blood in
you to that extent. What did it feel like&mdash;to kill the
man?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten," I told him. Yet I thought
then, as I knelt and looked up at him, that it might
be possible that I should know what it felt like again,
if he drove me too hard or goaded me too much. The
shabby garment of my slavery was slipping off me,
rag by rag, and leaving me something of what I had
been before; I began to be dimly afraid of myself, and
to what my inborn recklessness might drive me. For I,
who had died once, had no fear of any consequences.
I wondered if he thought of that, or remembered it.</p>

<p>He put an added torture upon me that night; he
made me wait at table. I don't know how it was
arranged that I should do that; I only know that at
the last moment I was told that I must be there to
hand the dishes&mdash;above all, to stand behind his chair,
and wait upon him specially. And so I stood in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
room where I had once been a guest, and waited upon
him and the others humbly enough.</p>

<p>At one end of the table sat Lucas Savell, with his
trembling hands fluttering about his plate and his
glass; at the other end&mdash;defiant, intolerant, insolent,&mdash;sat
Murray Olivant, talking loudly, and generally
dominating the occasion. At one side of the table, at
his right hand, sat Barbara, and next to her the man
Dawkins&mdash;a man who may best be described as one
having a perpetual smile. He even seemed to smile
as he ate; the most commonplace remark addressed
to him was met always with that smile, which seemed
indeed a part of the man. It was a smile that became
absolutely slavish whenever Murray Olivant threw a
word to him; but it was a veiled insolence when
Lucas Savell ventured a remark.</p>

<p>On the other side of the table young Arnold Millard
was seated, watching the girl. I saw ghosts again
then, when I saw Barbara with eyes downcast, and
when I watched the boy's hungry glances at her; I&mdash;the
servant who waited, and was unknown in that
house save to one man&mdash;saw myself watching hopelessly
enough the Barbara who was dead; my heart
ached for the boy, as it had ached years before for
poor Charlie Avaline.</p>

<p>The insolence of Olivant grew as the meal progressed.
I saw him once stretch out his arm, and lay a hand
strongly on the hand of the girl as it rested on the
table. "Now, my pretty Barbara," he said, "let's
have a word from you. You shouldn't be dumb at
your father's table."</p>

<p>"Is it my father's table?" she asked him, as she
raised her white face for a moment to his.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let's talk business, for the Lord's sake!"
he exclaimed. "At least, you might try to cheer our
friend opposite here," he went on, indicating the boy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
"he's as glum as you are. What's the matter, Arnold?&mdash;are
you in love?"</p>

<p>"I should scarcely talk about it, if I were," replied
the boy, with a glance at Olivant, and another at the
imprisoned hand of the girl.</p>

<p>"Of course you're in love," went on Olivant, still
holding that little hand tightly, and glancing from
one to the other across the table. "I wonder what
she's like; I wonder what sort of beauty would
most attract you. Come, Dawkins, let's have your
opinion."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Olivant, don't ask me!" exclaimed
Dawkins protestingly, and smiling more than ever.
"Perhaps, if I might hazard a guess&mdash;&mdash;" He glanced
as he spoke at Barbara next to him.</p>

<p>"I think Arnold would take rather to a full-blown
sort of beauty&mdash;something big and high-coloured,"
broke in Murray Olivant. "He'd be a bit of an
amateur at the game&mdash;and I doubt if she'd have any
money."</p>

<p>"Let go my hand!" It was the merest whisper,
but I heard it as I stood behind Olivant; I saw the
girl's distressed face, and I saw, too, that the boy's
hand had gripped a knife beside him, and that his look
was absolutely murderous. Olivant bent towards the
girl as though he did not understand; looked down
at the hand he held, and laughed.</p>

<p>"But it's such a pretty hand," he said&mdash;"belonging
to a pretty Barbara. Tell me, Dawkins," he called
to the other man, "hasn't one a right to hold a lady's
hand if one likes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, surely," said Mr. Dawkins. "Most
certainly."</p>

<p>Even as the words were spoken Barbara wrenched
her hand away, and sprang up; it seemed as though
Olivant and the boy sprang to their feet at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
time. Barbara went quickly to her father, and whispered
him for a moment, while he feebly protested;
then she made towards the door. The boy sprang to
the door to open it; Olivant moved quickly round the
table to intercept them both.</p>

<p>"Here, come back, come back! What the devil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door was opened, and the girl was gone; in the
tense silence that had fallen upon the room I heard
distinctly what Arnold Millard said, as he stood with
his back to the door looking at Olivant.</p>

<p>"Go and sit down!" Then, as the other man still
stood blusteringly before him, he made a sudden
movement, and I heard the words again: "Go and sit
down!"</p>

<p>Murray Olivant backed away from him, and got to
his place at the table; sank into his chair with an
uncomfortable laugh. The boy, after a moment's
hesitation, came back and sat down also. I noticed
that Savell's weak hands were fluttering about nervously,
but he said nothing, and the meal was resumed
in silence. Suddenly, however, Olivant, desiring some
vent for his feelings, turned fiercely upon me who was
standing looking at him.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you staring like that for?" he
demanded ferociously. "Don't you see that my glass
is empty?&mdash;can't you see that other people want wine
also? What in the name of all that's wonderful do
you think I keep a lout like you for?"</p>

<p>I went about my duties, and the man relapsed into
a sulky silence. He pushed his food away from him,
and began to mutter presently that he didn't know
what the world was coming to, when puppies were
allowed to bully their betters, and when slips of girls
failed to understand what a joke was. And at last
called down the length of the table to that poor master
of the house, Lucas Savell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come now, Mr. Savell, if you've quite finished we
can adjourn. I don't want to sit here all night."</p>

<p>"Quite finished, Olivant, quite finished," said Savell
hastily, as he rose from his chair. "Sorry there should
have been any little unpleasantness&mdash;but perhaps you
don't quite understand the child. She didn't mean
any unkindness&mdash;&mdash;" His voice trailed off, as he
went muttering and mumbling from the room. At a
sign from Olivant the man Dawkins followed him;
Olivant remained behind with the boy. Of me he took
no notice; I was but a piece of furniture in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," began Murray Olivant, setting
one foot upon a chair, and leaning his arm on his raised
knee&mdash;"I believe you want some money, don't you?
Don't be afraid to speak; you must surely understand
that I am in the best mood for giving you all you ask."</p>

<p>"I have asked for nothing," replied Arnold. "One
thing, however, I demand."</p>

<p>"Hear him, Tinman; he demands something, this
young jackanapes," exclaimed Olivant, turning to me,
and so dragging me into the business.</p>

<p>"I demand that you shall behave decently to that
young lady whom you insulted just now," said the boy,
growing very white, but speaking very distinctly.
"You dare not play the brute and the bully with
men, not even when, like my unlucky self, they're poor
as Job and are dependent upon you; you must bully
women instead."</p>

<p>"Silence&mdash;you young fool!" exclaimed Olivant.
"Do you think I'll be browbeaten by you? As for
your money, you can wait for it until I choose to give
it to you."</p>

<p>"There is no question of any gift; the money belongs
to me by right," exclaimed the boy. "I have
had to beg for every penny that I have ever had, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
it has all been mine from the beginning; if I
can't get it from you, I'll take some other measures&mdash;legally."</p>

<p>"Hear this beggar, Tinman; hear what he's going
to do!" cried Olivant, pointing to the boy, but looking
round at me. "It's a proper way to get what you want,
that is." He took a turn or two about the room, and
then came back to where Arnold was still standing.
"Let's have an understanding&mdash;once for all," he said, in
a changed voice. "Before you go out of this house I
want you to know that this tone of yours must cease.
You'll have money when I care to pay it to you; and
for the future you'll keep out of my way, and out of
the way of my friends. You have dared to lecture me
as to how I shall behave to this pretty baggage in this
house; she's nothing to you, and never will be. One of
these days she's going to belong to me&mdash;by her father's
wish; you'll find yourself left out in the cold. I can
put up with a boy's foolish whims and tricks for a
time; but I've put up with yours too long. Now you
can go."</p>

<p>"I shall go when it suits me; this house is not
yours," replied the other coolly, as he walked to the
door, and opened it, and went out.</p>

<p>After a moment or two Murray Olivant followed him;
he seemed at a loss to know what to do. I heard his
voice raised presently in the room on the other side of
the hall; I opened the door and listened. I was able
to see out into the hall also; I saw that Lucas Savell
stood at the foot of the stairs, as if he were just about
to climb them, and that Olivant was speaking to him
in his strident voice.</p>

<p>"Fetch her down, I say. I won't have her sulking
upstairs. If she won't come for you, I'll come myself."</p>

<p>"My dear Olivant!" began Savell pleadingly;
but the brutal voice broke in again quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"There&mdash;no words about it; tell her she's to come
down. It's an insult to me and to my guest."</p>

<p>Savell went slowly up the stairs, and Olivant went
back into the other room. Presently, through the
half-opened door, I saw Savell returning, with Barbara
walking by his side; she walked stiff and straight,
as her mother once had done on that very staircase,
when she went out of the house for the last time with
her husband. They disappeared together into that
other room.</p>

<p>For my own part, I was in a fever of doubt and dread;
I did not know what was going to happen. I knew
that presently the boy must leave the house in any
case; I knew, too, that that useless father would
presently drink himself into a muddled condition, and
so would remain, until in the small hours he contrived
to crawl away to bed. And I doubted and feared the
temper of Murray Olivant, as much as I doubted and
feared that perpetual smile on the face of his friend
Dawkins. I resolved to watch and to wait; for this
night at least I was again that unhappy boy, Charlie
Avaline, who had once suffered such tortures as young
Arnold Millard must be suffering now.</p>

<p>I crept out on to the terrace, outside those lighted
windows; peering in, I saw Olivant lounging at the
piano, evidently talking to the girl, who was seated
there; young Millard was listening to something
Dawkins was saying, but was evidently paying no
attention to him; his eyes were upon the two at the
piano. Presently, as if he could bear it no longer, he
made a movement to go; shook hands with Savell,
who feebly responded, and then crossed towards
Barbara. She rose to meet him, and with a courage
for which I should scarcely have given her credit, walked
with him towards the door. But even there Olivant
interposed; took the girl by the arm, and drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
away. I saw the look in the boy's eyes, and it sunk
deep into my mind, so that I did not lightly forget
it.</p>

<p>I went back into the house, and presently made my
way up towards my room. While I was yet on the
stairs, a door down below me opened; peering over,
I saw Barbara come out into the hall. At the same
moment Murray Olivant came out also, and behind
him in the doorway I saw the smiling face of Dawkins.
Olivant seized the girl before she had set foot
upon the stairs.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear, you're not going like that!" His
voice was thick and unsteady as he lurched against her.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she cried, in a subdued voice. "Let
me go, Mr. Olivant&mdash;or shall I call my father?"</p>

<p>"Call him, by all means; he's not likely to hear, or
to trouble much if he does hear," exclaimed Olivant.
"Come, you little witch&mdash;you're only shy because Dawkins
is looking on. You shall kiss me good-night at
least!"</p>

<p>She broke away from him, and darted up the stairs.
He stumbled in his blind rush after her, and she fled
past me like a hare; I heard her sobbing as she went,
and it seemed to set my numbed blood on fire. As he
stumbled up the stairs he came suddenly face to face
with me, standing looking at him. Dawkins, still grinning
awkwardly, stood in the doorway below.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, you fool!" exclaimed Olivant,
making a rush at me; but I did not move. I stood
like a thing of stone, staring at him, although in my
heart I was desperately afraid. Not of him&mdash;never of
him for a moment; but of what I might do.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" I said, in a voice that was not in
the least like my own. "Stand back!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, involuntarily
recoiling a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand back!" I said again. "I killed a man
once; there is a dread in me that I might do it again!"</p>

<p>He slowly retreated down two or three steps, still
looking at me; muttered something about talking to
me in the morning; then stumbled down to rejoin his
friend, and disappeared with him into the room. And
I sat on the stairs in the darkness, shaking from head
to foot, and desperately afraid of myself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

<a name="I_TOUCH_DISASTER" id="I_TOUCH_DISASTER">I TOUCH DISASTER</a></h3>


<p>I kept that watch upon the stairs until long after
the house was quiet. I drew back into a recess
once, when Murray Olivant and Dawkins went roaring
up to their respective rooms; and again when presently
Lucas Savell fumbled his trembling way up to his
particular quarters. Even after that there was a
great deal of noise for a time, because Dawkins and
Olivant appeared to take a particular delight in shouting
to each other from one room to the other as they
undressed.</p>

<p>But presently even they were quiet, and the dreary
old house seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the
shadows of the night. Keeping my lonely watch
there, I dreamed of all that had happened in the years
that were dead; thought chiefly, too, of my own utter
helplessness now. I was to have been strong and purposeful;
I was to have helped those who, like myself in
an earlier time, were helpless; I laughed bitterly to
think how weak I was, and how little I could do. I
tried to tell myself what my years were, and how I
ought to be strong and lusty; and then I remembered
that my hair was grey, and my face shrunken and old,
and my body weak. I had thought that I could cope
with the powers of position and strength and riches;
and I could do nothing.</p>

<p>Thinking I heard a noise above, I determined at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
that I would not go to bed yet; the girl seemed so
absolutely alone in that great house. I knew the room
in which she slept, and I presently crept up there, and
lay down across her doorway, to snatch some sleep in
that fashion. Even as I fell asleep I smiled to think
that it might have been the old Barbara I was guarding,
and not this new one, after all.</p>

<p>I awoke with a light on my face, and the consciousness
that some one was looking down at me. I started up
in a sitting posture, only half awake, and saw that the
door of the room was open, and that Barbara stood
there, with a candle in her hand, bending over me.
Our faces were very close together when she spoke in a
surprised whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tinman! What are you doing there?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean that you should be disturbed," I
said. "I only wanted to feel that you were safe."</p>

<p>"Dear kind Tinman!" she whispered, as the tears
gathered in her eyes. "I have not slept at all; I
have lain awake&mdash;thinking. You moved in your sleep,
I think, and brushed against the door, and I wondered
what it was. Come inside a moment."</p>

<p>She spoke in the faintest whisper, stopping every
now and then to listen intently. I got slowly to my
feet, and went just inside the door of the room; she
closed the door, and stood there with the candle in
her hand, looking at me. I remember that she looked
very frail and young, with her hair falling about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"What am I to do, Tinman?" she asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Indeed, I don't know," I replied.
"Life is always so hard, and there are so many
to make it harder for us. You did not quite trust me
to-day when I spoke to you," I added regretfully,
"or I might be able to speak to you more frankly."</p>

<p>"I do trust you," she said earnestly. "You stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
between me and that brute to-night; I peeped out and
saw you. I could not hear what you said; I only saw
him go down again. I bless you for that, Tinman."</p>

<p>"You see me only as a servant," I whispered, "but
I was not always like that. I want to say to you what
is in my heart. Your eyes smile at me, and so I can
speak with more confidence. You love this boy?"</p>

<p>To my surprise she was not in the least annoyed at
my bluntness of speech; she blushed quickly and prettily,
and nodded. "Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"And it is easy to see that he loves you. And you
ask me what you are to do?" I went on. "Surely it
is in your own hands, and in his?"</p>

<p>"But I would like you to tell me," she coaxed. "Of
course I know in my own mind what I want to do, or
I suppose I shouldn't be a woman; but one likes to
hear what a friend will say about a matter like this.
Tell me."</p>

<p>"I should advise you&mdash;both of you&mdash;to get away from
this house, and to start your lives in the best sense somewhere
else," I whispered earnestly. "You have no
friends here&mdash;no, not even your father; he would
marry you to this other man in sheer dread of him.
Youth only comes to you once, child, and you must
grasp it with both hands, and hold it as long as possible.
Take your lives into your hands, and go away, out into
the big clean world that loves lovers."</p>

<p>"You say just what is in my own heart, Tinman,"
she whispered, smiling, "and you speak as though you
knew all about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, ever so long ago I knew something about it&mdash;and
one never forgets. My life went down into the
shadowy places of the world, and was wrecked and
lost; I would not have yours do that."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so tenderly of me?" she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because you look at me with the eyes of the woman
I loved," I answered her.</p>

<p>"Where is she now?&mdash;what became of her?" she
whispered gently.</p>

<p>"She's dead."</p>

<p>She took my rough hand, and gave it a little squeeze.
I opened the door to go out, and she whispered
that I had comforted her, and that now she could
sleep. For a little time after that I sat outside the
door, with my arms round my knees, staring into the
darkness, and thinking that, after all, God had blessed
me rather more than I deserved. In the grey dawn I
stole up to my room at the top of the house, and lay
down, dressed as I was, on the bed to snatch some
further sleep.</p>

<p>It was late next morning when I heard Murray
Olivant bawling my name, and demanding with oaths
to know where I was. Somehow or other some of my
dread of the man had left me; I had a power I had not
before guessed at. I went to find him, and stood before
him&mdash;a stronger man than he, in the sense that I
was calm and silent, while he raved at me, and cursed
me, and showed himself a meaner, smaller thing with
every word he spluttered out. And I think he knew
it, and chafed at that violence he could not repress.</p>

<p>"There's something I want to say to you," he said
at last when he had exhausted himself a little. "You
threatened me last night&mdash;actually had the audacity to
threaten me, and to boast about what you had done,
and what you might do again."</p>

<p>"I did not threaten you&mdash;and I did not boast," I
said slowly. "And I only told you that I was afraid&mdash;afraid
of what I might do."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a threat. You talked of killing a
man&mdash;hinted that you might do it again. You know
what I told you would happen if you gave me any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
trouble. I said I'd kick you into the gutter&mdash;and
I'll do it. You can go to-day; get back to London,
and shiver in its streets&mdash;sell matches or beg. I've
done with you."</p>

<p>"Not yet," I replied, shaking my head. "You will
not get rid of me so easily as that, Mr. Olivant."</p>

<p>He stared at me with a dropping jaw. "Why, what
the devil do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you will find it better to have me with
you than against you," I said. "If you wanted an
ordinary servant, you should have taken an ordinary
man; you have taken me, who have nothing to lose,
and who troubles nothing about what he may gain.
Don't you understand," I asked impatiently, "that I
have stood under the shadow of the gallows, with Death
beckoning; what more have I to be afraid of? If you
kick me into the gutter, as you term it, I shall only rise
up again, and fight against you. More than that, I
might do worse; I might kill you if you gave me too
much trouble."</p>

<p>I must say one thing for Murray Olivant; he had
a sense of humour. He stared at me for a moment
or two after I had finished speaking, and then sat
down, and began to laugh. He laughed more and
more as he let my words sink into his mind; and
finally sat up and looked at me, shaking his head
whimsically as he did so.</p>

<p>"My word!&mdash;but you're a cool one!" he exclaimed.
"So you think I'm not to shake you off&mdash;eh? I'm
not to have a word to say about the matter; you're
to play a sort of old-man-of-the-sea to my Sindbad,
are you? Well, I think I like you for it&mdash;and I
think you may be more useful because you have so
little to lose. Only you mustn't threaten, and you
mustn't get in my way again when I've a joke afoot.
We'll say no more about it; we'll forget it." He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
got to his feet, and went striding about the room,
laughing to himself as at some excellent jest. "You
might even kill me! Oh, Lord&mdash;what a man I've
saddled myself with, to be sure!"</p>

<p>I stood still, waiting until he should have got over
the fit of laughter that was upon him; I waited
grimly for whatever other move might come. Presently
he sidled up to me, and with his arms akimbo
dug at me sideways with one elbow, and grinned into
my face.</p>

<p>"Protector of the poor, and the weak, and the
helpless&mdash;eh?" he taunted. "A sort of elderly
Cupid, setting out in the world fully equipped save
for the wings. Tell me, Cupid&mdash;what plot is hatching?
What are they going to do&mdash;these lovers?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know they were lovers," I replied. "I
thought <i>you'd</i> seen to that."</p>

<p>"And I have," he exclaimed, with sudden heat.
"You may be sure of that. The boy may fly into
tantrums, and the girl may sulk and cry&mdash;but the
poor folks can't do anything. I hold the moneybags,
and I can afford to let these people weep, and
gnash their teeth, and cry out against me; I shall
have my own way in the long run."</p>

<p>"You always do, you know," I reminded him
slyly.</p>

<p>"Of course I do, Tinman," he assented. "But
won't you tell me what plot's afoot, or what the
simpletons think of doing? What's the game: do
they kill me first, and run away together afterwards&mdash;or
is old Savell to be brought to his knees&mdash;or
what's the game?"</p>

<p>"I don't know of any game," I said. "As you
have already said, the game's in your hands, and I
expect you'll win it in the long run."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall," he cried quickly. "Only you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
a devilish sly fox, and I'm rather suspicious that you
may be thinking of playing tricks. For your own
sake, Tinman, you'd better not."</p>

<p>So soon as he had dismissed me I went off to try
and find Barbara. My position in the house did not
make that an easy task; for she was with her father,
and I had no excuse for breaking in upon them. I
went into the grounds at last, in the hope that she
might come out there, and that I might have a chance
to speak to her. But I had to wait for a long time
before she came towards me, trailing through the
dead leaves dejectedly enough. I watched her out
of sight of the house, and then went towards her.</p>

<p>She seemed glad to see me&mdash;grateful for what I
had done, and eager to thank me again. I urged upon
her the necessity for seeing young Millard at the
earliest possible moment, and making some arrangement
with him.</p>

<p>"I dare not go away from the house," she said,
glancing at its windows through the trees. "I am
watched everywhere, and I might bring fresh trouble
upon you. After last night, Tinman, I am afraid to
see those two men together."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment or two, and then turned
quickly to her. "I can see him," I said, "and arrange
with him what is best to be done. I'll slip down into
the town and try to find him. You must get away,
both of you; there is nothing else to be done." I
was as eager as a boy about it; I wanted to see them
running off into the world, hand in hand, to face it
together.</p>

<p>"Go to him then," she said, "and tell him that I
will do anything and everything he suggests. Only
pray him, for the love of God, to let it be soon. I
cannot stay much longer in this house."</p>

<p>I had just begun to assure her that I would slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
away at the earliest opportunity when a change in
her face warned me that some one was approaching
us; I turned guiltily, and saw, not a dozen yards away,
the man Dawkins, as smiling as ever, lighting a cigarette.
I did not know where he had sprung from, nor
how long he had seen us talking together; from his
appearance he might have been taking an aimless
stroll through the grounds, and so have lighted upon
us suddenly.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Savell," he said, ignoring
me, and waving a hand to the girl. "We've been
disconsolate without you&mdash;wondering what had happened
to you, and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I have been with my father," she replied hastily,
making a movement towards the house. "You
will not forget, Tinman," she called back to me, as
though reminding me of some order she had given
me.</p>

<p>"No, miss; I will not forget," I said. I watched
her as she walked back to the house, with Dawkins
strolling beside her, evidently talking airily as he
waved his cigarette.</p>

<p>It must have been an hour after that, and I had
not yet found an opportunity to get away, when
Murray Olivant summoned me, and told me he was
starting at once for London. I found him in a room
with Dawkins&mdash;the latter was seated in an armchair,
reading a newspaper and smoking; he took no notice
of Olivant or of myself. Olivant, for his part, seemed
worried about something; mentioned to me quite confidentially
that he had decided to go to London that
day, on account of some sudden business he had forgotten.
He was quite cordial with me; told me to
put a few things together in a bag, as he did not
expect to be back that night.</p>

<p>I saw in a moment in this the golden opportunity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
which we were all waiting. With Olivant out of
the way we might do anything; for I did not reckon
Dawkins in the matter at all. If I thought about
him in any way, it was as an amiable fool, who had
nothing to do with the matter.</p>

<p>I packed the bag, and then quite naturally suggested
that I should carry it to the station in the
town. Olivant thanked me quite cordially, and said
he should be glad; and I laughed to think how easily
and naturally I was going to get down into the town
of Hammerstone Market, to find young Arnold Millard.
I think I rather despised Murray Olivant for being
so simple over the matter.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come with me, Dawkins?"
asked Olivant at the last moment as we were starting.
"There's nothing for you to do here, you know."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," growled the other from behind his
paper. "I'm jolly comfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," retorted his friend. "Ring the
bell if you want anything; Tinman will look after
you."</p>

<p>We set off to walk to the station; I understood
from Olivant that there was a train he would quite
easily catch. I wondered what he would say when
he returned from London on the following day, and
discovered, as in all probability he would, that the
two poor birds he was trying to crush had flown. I
was quite exultant over the way things were playing
into my hand; I found myself mapping out in my
mind exactly what I should say to him, when on his
return he should demand an explanation.</p>

<p>He had some ten minutes to wait when we reached
the station; he lit a cigar, and began to pace up and
down the platform, with his mind evidently bent
on the expedition before him. I stood obediently
near his bag, waiting to hand it to him when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
train should arrive, and going over in my own mind
how I should set about the task before me. Suddenly
Olivant strolled towards me, watch in hand.</p>

<p>"You'd better not wait, Tinman," he said, more
kindly than he had spoken yet. "It's a cold morning,
and there's no necessity for you to stand about
here. Thanks for carrying the bag; I can manage
with it now."</p>

<p>"I don't mind waiting in the least," I began; but
he pushed me away good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; get off with you!" he cried. "And
don't forget what I told you about being watchful,"
he added in a lower tone, and with his hand on
my shoulder. "Not one alone, mind&mdash;but everybody."</p>

<p>I went out of the station, and took my way down into
the town. I had scarcely gone a hundred yards
when I heard the whistle of the train in the distance;
I stood still in the little High Street, pleasing myself
with the thought of how at this moment Olivant
was opening a carriage door, and now was in the
carriage ready for his journey. I heard the whistle
of the train again, and knew that he had started on
that long journey to London, and that I was free. I
laughed to myself, and turned round, and went on
my way in search of Arnold Millard.</p>

<p>I failed to find him at the little hotel in the town;
they told me there that he had gone out, and would
probably not be back until much later in the day. I
chafed at the delay, because I knew that time was of
value, and whatever had to be done must be done
before Olivant returned. While I was standing in
the High Street, wondering what I should do, I felt
a touch upon my arm, and turned, to see Jervis Fanshawe
standing beside me. He beckoned to me
mysteriously, and I followed him down a little lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
which turned off from the main street of the town,
and led down among some tumbledown cottages.
There he stopped, and fronted me, with a nervous
grin upon his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Brother Derelict," he said, "and how are
things going with our friend? What takes Murray
Olivant to London just now?"</p>

<p>"Business," I replied shortly. "He won't be
back until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime you plot mischief&mdash;eh?"
he suggested. "Oh, I know you&mdash;and I know what
you mean to do&mdash;and I don't blame you. Serve
the brute while it pays you, but work behind his
back all the same. That's the ticket."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," I replied, looking at
him steadily. "I've just seen Mr. Olivant off at the
station, and I'm now going back to my duties at
the house."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he sneered, as he thrust his face into
mine. "And that was the reason that you went
into the <i>George</i> just now, and so anxiously inquired
concerning the whereabouts of our young friend
Millard&mdash;eh? I was in the bar at the side, and heard
every word. Idiot!&mdash;why can't you be more candid
with me? I only want to work with you; I'm not
against you."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," I replied. "At all
events, I mean to do whatever is in my mind solely
on my own account. I'm fighting now not only for the
boy, but for my own dead boyhood, away back in
the past. It won't be wise of you if you attempt
to stop me."</p>

<p>"My dear Charlie, I'd be the last to stop you,"
he asserted, seizing my hand and giving it a squeeze.
"We work together; our interests are the same.
Trust me, Charlie&mdash;you'll never regret it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't intend to trust any one," I said. Then,
in an incautious moment, I added exultantly&mdash;"I
mean to snatch both these young people out of the
clutches of Olivant; I mean to set them free. And
not you nor all the world shall prevent me."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I wouldn't prevent you, even if
I could. It won't be half a bad thing to do; I shall
be quite pleased for you to take a rise out of Murray
Olivant; I hate the man."</p>

<p>"Your feelings have changed somewhat too rapidly,"
I said. "I won't trust you, Fanshawe."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll help you, whether you like it or not,"
he said, with a laugh. "Young Millard has gone
down into the woods. I followed him there not an
hour ago."</p>

<p>I looked at the man doubtfully; I did not know
what to believe. I was so utterly alone in this business
of plotting and counterplotting, and I wanted so
much to rely on some one for help and advice. I
decided, however, that I would have nothing to do
with him; with a nod I turned away.</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry," he called after me. "I could
help you if you'd let me."</p>

<p>I took no notice of him; I went on my way steadily.
I began even to regret that I had made that bombastic
speech to him about snatching the two young
people out of the clutches of Murray Olivant. I saw
that there was the more need for hurry; I went on
with long strides towards the wood.</p>

<p>After a long search I found the boy; he was making
rough sketches of a part of the wood, not with any
serious intention to work, I am convinced, but because
he hoped that Barbara might pass that way.
I stole upon him unawares; suddenly presented
myself before him, and blurted out what I wanted
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Millard, I have been looking for you everywhere,"
I said. "It is on account of Miss Barbara
Savell."</p>

<p>He turned to me quickly. "Do you come from
her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and no," I faltered. "Last night, after
you had gone, the man Olivant tried to insult her; I
was so lucky as to be in the way&mdash;and I&mdash;I stayed
near her for the rest of the night. You must take
her away from that house at once."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the house first, and see Olivant," he
exclaimed fiercely, as he began to pack up his things.
"Tried to insult her, did he?" While he spoke
he was savagely tugging at straps and buckles, in a
violent hurry to start.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I entreated. "In the first place, Olivant
is not there; he's gone to London."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" He looked up at me quickly.</p>

<p>"I have seen him start myself," I assured him.
"This is your opportunity; let him come back to
find the bird flown. If the child were here, she would
be able to explain to you so much better than I can&mdash;would
be able to tell you that I am her friend and
yours&mdash;fighting for you both, for a reason you will
never understand. You must take her away, out of
that frightful house; you must marry her&mdash;and
face the world with her."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;has she told you&mdash;about me?" He had
got to his feet, and was looking at me curiously.
"What has she told you?"</p>

<p>"That she loves you," I replied simply. "I that
am but a poor servant&mdash;a nobody in the world&mdash;tell
you this, and beg you with all the strength that is in me
to take her away. She will go gladly; she will make
your life what it could never be without her."</p>

<p>"You're a strange man," he said wonderingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"But if she trusts you&mdash;well, so will I. What is
best to be done?"</p>

<p>"There is another man in the house&mdash;left behind
by Olivant," I replied eagerly&mdash;"and he will have
his instructions, no doubt, to be on guard. If you
will wait till darkness sets in, I will arrange that Miss
Barbara shall slip out of the house, and meet you
where you like. It must be to-night; to-morrow will
be too late."</p>

<p>"Why could she not come earlier?" demanded
the boy. "There is the rest of the day before us;
surely she could slip away?"</p>

<p>"And be called for by her father, or watched
and followed by the man Dawkins," I reminded him.
"No; if she slips away after her father and Dawkins
have settled down for the evening, there will be time
for you to get to the junction, and get a train from
there to London; she will not be missed for hours&mdash;perhaps
not till the morning&mdash;and then pursuit would
be useless. Give me a message to her, and I will
go back at once and deliver it."</p>

<p>"Could you not manage to bring her to me, Tinman?"
he suggested suddenly. "If they were
watching, it would not do for me to come too near
the house, and I do not like the thought of her wandering
about in the darkness by herself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I could do that easily," I replied, "as
Olivant is away. But you must arrange a meeting-place."</p>

<p>"I will be at the point on the road where the path
leaves it to enter this wood," he said, after a moment's
thought. "I can stand back among the trees there, and
watch you coming. I will not leave that spot until
you come, however late it is. The rest must be a
matter of chance. If we can't reach the junction
in time for the train, I'll find a cottage somewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and some good woman into whose hands I can put the
girl. I'll write a note to her now, just to tell her that
she is to put herself in your hands."</p>

<p>He tore a sheet of paper from his sketch-book, and
rapidly wrote. "That is just to tell her that I will
be waiting, and that you are to bring her to me,"
he said, as he folded the paper and gave it to me.
"Some day, Tinman, my dear wife and I will be able
to thank you. I wish I knew why you have done
this."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day you may know that too," I
replied, as I thrust the paper into my pocket. "I
shall be at the spot you mention at about eight o'clock."</p>

<p>I went back to the house, and was fortunate enough
to find Barbara at once. She was crossing the hall,
and I stopped her eagerly, and began to whisper the
message, even while I fumbled clumsily in my pockets
for the note.</p>

<p>"I've seen Mr. Millard, and he has arranged everything,"
I began. "You are to meet to-night at the
end of the path leading into the wood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall want you to wait at lunch, Tinman,"
she broke in loudly, and drawing away a little. I
knew at once that we had a listener; as I bowed and
turned away, I saw the man Dawkins standing in
the doorway of the dining-room. He smiled with
that dazzling smile of his at Barbara; transferred the
smile to me when he asked me to be good enough to
get him a whisky and soda. There was nothing for
it but for me to turn away; I saw his eyes following
me, and I knew that I dared not pass the note to the
girl then. As she moved away a little, however, I
went after her with a quick&mdash;"Excuse me, miss,"
and whispered again: "Be ready at eight at the outer
gate of the grounds. I will be there to take you."</p>

<p>I strove during the remainder of that day to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
up that twisted scrap of paper I had in my pocket;
but I was baulked on every occasion. Now it was
Savell who came suddenly upon us as I was approaching
Barbara; now it was Dawkins, strolling about
the house, and bringing his smile to bear suddenly
round a corner. Once when I went to her room I
found it empty, and I dared not leave the thing
there. The day wore on, and I was counting the
hours until the moment should arrive when I could
meet her in the grounds.</p>

<p>It was more than half-past seven, and the house
was very still, when I thought I heard a noise in one of
the rooms above. Thinking it might be Barbara
moving about, and that here was the opportunity to
speak to her, I stole cautiously upstairs. The sound
came from Murray Olivant's bedroom; I opened the
door quickly, and walked in. Some one was standing
at the further side of the room, in the dim light that
came through the windows; but before I could see
who it was, I felt myself seized in a powerful grip from
behind, and forced to my knees. I was too surprised
even to cry out; but I had a vague idea that something
dreadful had happened to me and to my schemes,
when the figure at the further end of the room twisted
quickly round, and turned up the gas, which had
been burning as a mere tiny speck of light. Then I
saw that the man was Murray Olivant.</p>

<p>I was going to cry out in earnest then, with some
vague idea of raising an alarm, when I felt a twisted
cloth forced into my mouth and tied tightly behind;
my arms were already secured. So I remained on
my knees, helpless; I turned my head, and saw
Dawkins standing beside me, smiling as delightfully
as ever.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dawkins," said Murray Olivant,
with a nod; "that was rather neatly done. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
will you have the goodness to run through his pockets,
and see if you can find anything?"</p>

<p>I made a feeble attempt to struggle, but it was
useless. The deft fingers of Mr. Dawkins swiftly
brought to light the note that young Millard had
written but a few hours before; he tossed it across
to Olivant. The latter opened it slowly, and read what
was written there by the light of the gas jet. Then
he turned to me, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, you sly devil!" he said in a whisper.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />

<a name="LOVE_WITH_THE_VEILED_FACE" id="LOVE_WITH_THE_VEILED_FACE">LOVE WITH THE VEILED FACE</a></h3>


<p>I crouched there on the floor, with my arms
securely pinioned behind me, and unable to
cry out. The man Dawkins had seated himself, after
making certain that he had secured me; Murray
Olivant had finished his perusal of the note, and was
standing tapping his lips with it, evidently deep in
thought. He pulled out his watch and looked at it;
slipped the watch back into his pocket, and turned
again to the note. He read it aloud&mdash;with interpolations
of his own.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span> (like his impudence, I must say!),&mdash;</p>

<p>"That good fellow Tinman (oh, you sly devil!)
will tell you what I have decided to do. I will be
waiting at the path that leads into the wood at about
eight o'clock; you are to come with Tinman without
fear (brave, sweet, kind Tinman, so very useful in a
crisis!). He will bring you to me, and after that you
will have nothing to trouble about. Trust me as
much as I know you love me, and all will be well.
Until we meet in an hour or two,</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"Ever your own,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Arnold</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>He twisted up the note, and came slowly across
the room to where I crouched waiting. While he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
talked to me, in that hard deadly level voice of his,
he launched a kick at me every now and then to
punctuate what he said.</p>

<p>"You thought I was safely out of the way."&mdash;A
kick.&mdash;"You meant to play me false, and send this
boy flying, with love for company&mdash;eh?"&mdash;Another
kick.&mdash;"You dog!&mdash;do you think you're likely to
win in such a game as this, when you're fighting against
me?"&mdash;Another kick more savage than the others.&mdash;"Look
at him, Dawkins; see how brave he is
now!"</p>

<p>If I could have got my hands free, I know that I
should have made a fight for it, and that in my despair
I might have killed or maimed one or other of the
men. But I was too tightly bound to be able to move;
Dawkins had most skilfully knotted a long bath towel
about my elbows, so that my shoulders ached with
the strain upon them. I struggled to my feet, and
leant against the wall, glancing from one man to the
other, and wondering what they meant to do.</p>

<p>"I set you to watch, my dear Tinman," said Murray
Olivant between his teeth; "and the better to be
sure of you, I had you watched also. You've interested
yourself a little too much in regard to this young
lady, who, at the present moment I expect, is waiting
in the cold and the darkness for you. That's a pleasant
thought, isn't it? There they stand&mdash;the pair of
them; the girl, impatient to hear your footstep;
the boy, shivering at the edge of the wood, waiting
for you both. Think of that, Tinman; they so near
together, and never by any chance to meet."</p>

<p>I stood there, with the sweat dropping off me,
straining vainly at my bonds, and striving to work
the gag loose with my teeth. Olivant laughed at my
struggles; flicked the note at me, and went on derisively&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our friend Dawkins here gave me the tip this
morning, and I decided that it might be a good idea
to make you believe that you'd got the day and the
night to yourself. I didn't get into the train, and
my luggage is still at the station. I came back, after
a decent interval, and waited for you, Tinman. Now
the only thing to be decided&mdash;and we have just ten
minutes in which to decide it, unless we are to keep
the lady waiting in the cold&mdash;is what to do in regard
to these two people, who stand so far apart, longing
for you to bring them together. I can't remove
your gag, Tinman, or you might shout; but I should like
to know what you would do if the choice rested with
you."</p>

<p>I stood there, enduring a torture greater than any
I had endured yet. I seemed to see Arnold Millard
standing at the edge of the wood, waiting and longing
and hoping; saw the girl watching the house in which
I was held prisoner, and miserably blaming me in
her heart for having turned traitor. The two men in
the room with me must have guessed what was passing
in my mind; they were whispering together, and
shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>"But you shan't go disappointed, Tinman; that
wouldn't be fair," exclaimed Olivant after a pause.
"You may not go yourself to meet the lady, but you
shall send a letter to her; we must be polite at all
costs. You shall explain that you are unavoidably
detained; more than that, you shall send some one
in your place. Dawkins shall take up the tale you
have begun; Dawkins is quite the ladies' man at a
pinch&mdash;aren't you, Dawkins?"</p>

<p>"I'm always for a bit of sport," exclaimed Mr.
Dawkins, grinning.</p>

<p>Murray Olivant went across to a window, and pulled
aside the curtain; he looked cautiously out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
grounds. After a moment he turned, and jerked his
head, as a sign to the other man to join him.</p>

<p>"There she is, Dawkins&mdash;there by the gate," he
said, in a low voice. "See how patiently she waits&mdash;how
certain she is that the faithful Tinman will not
fail her in this hour of need! You can see the moonlight
on her, Dawkins&mdash;and mighty pretty she
looks!"</p>

<p>I went across the room suddenly, and fell upon my
knees before the man, and raised my face to his. I
could not speak, but I tried to throw into my expression
the prayer to him that was in my heart. He
watched me as he might have watched some one with
whom he was not concerned at all; touched the man
Dawkins on the arm, to call his attention to me. Then
suddenly his manner changed; he bent down and
looked into my eyes, and spoke in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"You have set your puny strength against mine,
and have learnt your lesson," he said. "Now you
shall hear what I mean to do&mdash;you shall understand
what you and the impudent dog who pretends to love
her have brought upon her. I meant to marry her;
that was part of the plan I had formed, if she had
behaved properly and as her father wished. But her
kisses have been for her lover, and for that she shall
pay. I'll have her taken away to-night under false
pretences&mdash;I'll drag her down through the mud; she
shall crawl to my feet, and beg me to kill her for very
shame of what she is. And then I'll send her back
to the boy she set before me. And you, Tinman&mdash;you,
my jail-bird&mdash;you will have done it!"</p>

<p>I knelt there in agony, praying madly and vainly
that God would set me free or strike me dead.
Olivant had turned to Dawkins; together they
were examining the note they had found upon me.</p>

<p>"It's scarcely likely that she knows this fellow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
writing," said Olivant, indicating me with a glance.
"If you're careful you can take a note to her that will
seem to come from him; you're a plausible rascal,
Dawkins, and she may fall into the trap. You know
where the boy's waiting; we'll tell her the plan's been
changed, and she's to go in the other direction. Take
her to London, and wait instructions there. Now for
a little forgery in a gentle cause."</p>

<p>They chuckled together over the note that was to
be signed with my name. It was short enough, and
they brought it to me that I might hear it read.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am suspected, and dare not leave the house. I
have had to change the plan at the last moment, but
have been lucky enough to find a good friend to help
you and Mr. Millard. I thought he was a friend only
of Mr. Olivant, but in that I was mistaken. Trust
him completely; he will take you straight to Mr.
Millard. This is the only way in which it can be
managed; if I left the house now I should be followed.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"<span class="smcap">Tinman.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"By Jove&mdash;that's devilish clever!" exclaimed
Mr. Dawkins, looking at it in admiration. "The only
thing is&mdash;I'm afraid the lady may be suspicious."</p>

<p>"That's quite unlikely," said Murray Olivant
impatiently. "The mere fact of your carrying a note
signed by Tinman shows that you must know all about
the business, and you can only have known all about
it from him. To London with her; I'll join you in
twenty-four hours, after I've decided what to do with
this fellow and with my worthy half-brother. I must
tread warily, for I have two desperate men to settle
accounts with." He laughed, and kicked me softly
again.</p>

<p>Dawkins shook hands with him, and went out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the room, closing the door after him. Olivant turned
the key in the door, as though he feared I might run
out, bound and gagged as I was, to try to stop her;
and indeed that thought had been in my mind. Then
he took up his position at the window, and with a
mocking smile on his face began to describe what was
happening.</p>

<p>"She starts and turns her head, Tinman, when she
hears his step," he began. "Now she comes slowly
towards him; they meet, and she is listening intently.
Now she reads the note; in the politest way, my dear
Tinman, he has lighted a match, and is shading it with
his hands while she reads. I know you're praying
hard, Tinman, that she may suspect, and refuse to
go; I'm praying hard that she may be fool enough
to believe, and to trust herself to Dawkins. I wonder
which prayer will avail?"</p>

<p>I was indeed praying hard, but there was no hope
in my heart that my prayer would be answered. He
looked again out of the window, and laughed, and
nodded at me.</p>

<p>"She has hesitated but for a moment," he said.
"They move towards the gate; he opens it for her.
She looks back at the house for a moment&mdash;see,
I kiss my fingers to her, although she does not know
it!&mdash;now they are passing out. The gate shuts.
They are gone."</p>

<p>He left the window, and dropped into a chair, and
burst into a shout of laughter. I crouched on the
floor at his feet, with my arms bound behind me, and
with my head bowed on my breast.</p>

<p>"I know your story, Tinman," he said at last, when
his mirth had subsided a little; "Fanshawe told me
something of it. You were a Quixote, I believe; you
killed a man because he spoke ill of a woman, or would
have done her harm. Look at you now!&mdash;a broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
worn-out thing, with all your bombast and bravado
gone; all your threats and your heroics mere words
blown away by the wind. And if you were free&mdash;what
would you not do?&mdash;what doughty deeds of
heroism&mdash;eh? And behold, the excellent Dawkins
is on his way to London, with a trusting girl for company;
behold also&mdash;I shall follow very shortly. Bow
your head, Tinman, for you are indeed a ghastly
failure!"</p>

<p>After that for a time he busied himself about the
room, casting a word at me now and then over his
shoulder. I had got to my feet, and was sitting
dejectedly enough on a chair, thinking miserably of
what I had done; I no longer felt the discomfort of the
gag or the ache in my shoulders; I was past physical
suffering of any kind. After what seemed a long time,
Olivant went across to the door and unlocked it;
stood for a moment there, looking back at me contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You'll be safe here for a time, Tinman," he said.
"A little later I'll come and release you. I'm sorry
for your young friend, shivering in the wood and
waiting hopelessly; but some one had to suffer. And
when I see that other friend of yours&mdash;sweet little
Barbara&mdash;in London, I'll exonerate you, and explain
to her that it wasn't really your fault. Make yourself
as comfortable as you can, Tinman, under disagreeable
circumstances."</p>

<p>He took the key out of the lock, and transferred it
to the outside of the door; then went away, locking me
in. It did not seem to matter; I had failed hopelessly,
and I did not mind what became of me. I had striven
to do so much&mdash;had flung myself into this business
with the ardour of a youth; but my youth was a thing
of the past, and I was only a tired old man, easily
beaten in an unequal struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat there for a long time, picturing horribly enough
to myself all that might be happening to those in whom
I was interested. I saw the boy waiting among the
trees, and listening for every sound that floated to him&mdash;now
certain that I was coming with the girl fast along
the road to him&mdash;now blaming me bitterly because
by carelessness or intentionally I had betrayed him.
I saw the girl, too, in the hands of the scoundrel with
whom she had so willingly set off on a journey that
must end in disaster; and I ground my teeth on the
gag that had been forced between them, in bitter
despairing rage at the man who seemed to hold us all
in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>Slowly the shame and degradation of the thing
seemed to drop into my soul like a subtle poison. In a
world that should be fair and bright&mdash;a world made for
lovers&mdash;it was horrible and unnatural to think that
such a creature as Murray Olivant should triumph
over love and beauty and purity. Poor sorry knight
that I was, for ever tilting at such monsters as himself,
I had already been worsted once in the battle, and
rendered, as it seemed, for ever useless; and now
again, when I would be taking up the fight with fresh
vigour, I had been flung at the first encounter, and
my enemy triumphed. What a poor sorry spectacle I
had made of myself, and how little good I had really
done!</p>

<p>I began to have again that bitter rage in my heart
that had been in it twenty years before, and had
meant the death of a man. I found myself saying,
over and over again, as I sat bound and helpless, that
this man should die, no matter what the penalty might
be&mdash;that I would wipe him off the face of the fair earth
on which he crawled, and would leave the way clear
for this new Barbara, and for the boy who had striven
bravely to carry the flag I once had borne. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
could happen to me worse than had already happened;
I felt in that hour almost as though God had brought
me from my prison, and set me here to do this thing.
And I had been chosen because no worse evil could
befall me than I had already suffered; I had touched
the depths, and could go no lower. Yes, I was a thing
apart, and the way before me was as clear as it had
been twenty years before.</p>

<p>I set to work systematically to free myself of my
bonds. Getting to my feet, I stumbled stiffly towards
the dressing-table in the room, and on the sharp edge
at one corner of it began to saw the towel that held
me, backwards and forward, until I had torn a hole in
it. After that I worked frantically&mdash;up and down
and across and across&mdash;until I felt it giving in places,
and until I had torn a great jagged hole in it. It took a
long time, but presently I was able to feel that the towel
was gradually giving way; then at last, as I worked, I
was suddenly flung forward, as the last strand started,
and my hands fell to my sides. The rest was an easy
matter, and I was presently able to get rid of my gag.</p>

<p>The door was locked, and I dared not break it down;
I did not know whether Olivant was still in the house.
I pulled back the curtain at the window, and looked
out, after first extinguishing the light in the room.
The room was on the first floor, and the drop to the
ground not an alarming one; I crawled on to the broad
window-ledge, and worked myself over it, gripping
with my hands. After hanging there for a moment
I let go, and dropped, and fell without damage to the
ground below.</p>

<p>At first I did not know what to do. On an impulse
I was for setting out for the woods, there to find Arnold
Millard, and acquaint him with what had happened. But
in the very act of doing that I drew back, trembling;
for I seemed to know what must inevitably happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
then. Living, as I seemed to do, in the intimate
thoughts and hopes and hatreds of the boy, I knew that
what must happen would be an encounter between
Murray Olivant and the younger man; and whatever
punishment must be meted out to Olivant must, I
felt, be left to me, and not to the boy. Before I stirred
at all in the matter I must have time to think, and I
must, above all, find out whether Murray Olivant was
still in the house.</p>

<p>I could not, of course, get into the house again in the
ordinary way; I must needs creep about the grounds,
and watch. I went round to the terrace, and drew near
enough to look in at the windows, and to see Lucas
Savell sitting alone in the room, with his hands folded
on his lap, and his head nodding to slumber. I tried
gently to unfasten one of the long French windows,
but in vain; and I was just turning away, when I saw
him wake up, and shake his head, and blink his eyelids,
and look about him. I saw him go to the door of the
room, and apparently call out to some one in the house;
then come back, closing the door after him. He made
straight for the windows, and I was only just in time
to draw back out of the way. After fumbling for a
moment or two with the fastenings, he got the window
open, and called out into the dark garden&mdash;</p>

<p>"Barbara! Barbara! What's become of you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he stood for a moment
fretfully muttering to himself. I was so close to him
that I heard him say that no one ever attended to his
wants, and that he was a poor neglected creature, and
he wished that he was dead. While he stood there,
the door of the room was opened, and Olivant came in.</p>

<p>"What are you bawling about?" I heard him ask.</p>

<p>Savell turned away from the window, leaving it
open. "I want Barbara," he said peevishly. "She
knows I want her at this time; there are lots of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
she has to attend to that no one else can attend to.
I'm actually left here&mdash;a poor invalid&mdash;with nothing to
drink. It's a shame!"</p>

<p>"You're not likely to see your precious Barbara
again&mdash;at all events for a long time," said Murray
Olivant, leaning against a table, and looking at the
other man. "So make up your mind to that."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Savell stared at him, with a frightened
look on his face. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that the lady has taken matters into her
own hands, and has run away with that scoundrelly
half-brother of mine&mdash;young Millard," said Olivant
slowly. "He's been hanging about here for a long
time&mdash;before ever he came to dinner at all&mdash;and I've
been afraid that something of this sort would happen.
It's a pity; because I had a better fate in store for
the girl, as you know."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;of course I know that," said Savell
feebly. "But can't they be stopped?&mdash;can't something
be done?"</p>

<p>"I intend to do something&mdash;to-morrow," said
Olivant. "It's too late to do anything to-night,"
he added, glancing at his watch. "Make your mind
easy, my friend; I'll see that sweet Barbara comes
to no harm. And if by any chance young Millard
should come here, you'll understand that that's only
a ruse on his part, to throw you off the scent. You'll
very properly have him kicked out of the house."</p>

<p>I had been so intent upon what was happening in
the room, and upon the words that passed between the
two men, that I had been totally unaware of the fact
that once again, as on another night I remembered, a
shadow had detached itself from the shadows of the
garden, and that what seemed to be a woman was
leaning forward eagerly at the further end of the
terrace, watching and listening. She had not seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
me; she had crept forward step by step, and was
staring into the lighted room. As Murray Olivant
moved with a shiver towards the window as if to
close it, she dropped back into the shadows, and was
gone.</p>

<p>For a moment I stood there, staring after her, and
vaguely calling to mind the fashion in which I had
seen her before, and the white face I had seen looking
into the room. Then, recovering myself, I started off
quickly in pursuit&mdash;hearing her moving swiftly over
the dead leaves on her way out of the grounds. Getting
further away from the house, I ventured to call to
her to stop; but she hastened on more quickly, breaking
at last into a run, and finally disappearing among
the trees. I ran on blindly, and just when I thought
I had lost her stumbled against a figure standing quite
still, and grasped it, and held to it. But this was not a
woman; it was a man, who cried out feebly to me to
let him go, and struggled in my grasp. It was Jervis
Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"Some one ran past you&mdash;not a moment ago," I
gasped. "A woman."</p>

<p>His face in the moonlight was ghastly white; I
felt that he was trembling from head to foot. "Did
you see it too?" he gasped, holding to me, and staring
into my face.</p>

<p>I nodded. "Yes," I replied quickly. "Who was
it?"</p>

<p>He shivered, and covered his face with his hands.
"The dead come alive!" he whispered.</p>

<p>I thought at first that he had been scared by the
hurried flight of the woman, or by my own calling to
her in the darkness; above all, I was too anxious concerning
what I had to do, and concerning the fugitive,
to take much note of him. With an impatient exclamation
I thrust him aside, and ran on quickly out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
grounds; but when I came to the road outside I saw
that it lay like a grey streak under the light of the moon,
and was empty. A little frightened and shaken, I
determined then and there that there was but one
thing to be done; I must find the boy, and must tell
him what had happened in regard to Barbara.</p>

<p>But even as I started on that errand I heard footsteps
behind me, and saw Fanshawe&mdash;a mere tottering
shadow of a man&mdash;coming along the road after me,
calling to me feebly to wait. But I ran on, taking no
notice of him, and presently came to the end of the
path that led into the wood. I dropped down there,
calling to the boy softly as I went.</p>

<p>He stepped out to confront me at once, and I shall
remember to my dying day the look upon his face
when he saw that I was alone. He held to me for a
moment in the silence of the wood; then shook me
roughly, and flung me aside.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he demanded, staring about him
like one distracted.</p>

<p>"Gone!" I replied, clinging to him, in dreadful fear
that he might break away from me when he heard the
news, and make for the house. "Spirited away to
London."</p>

<p>He stood quite still, with his hand pressed against
his forehead, staring at me dreadfully while I went
on to explain what had happened, and how I had been
tricked. Then, with a laugh that was almost a sob,
he broke away from me, and sprang for the road. I
caught him as he went, and struggled with him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I panted.</p>

<p>Even before he answered the question I heard the
shuffling running footsteps of Jervis Fanshawe go past
us on the road above; the man was still gaspingly
calling my name. The footsteps died away, and I
became aware that young Millard was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to find Murray Olivant," said the boy
between his teeth. "Let me go!"</p>

<p>"You're too late," I lied to him. "He's gone too."
For I knew that at that time it would have been madness
to let him go to the house in search of his brother.</p>

<p>He suddenly turned from me, with all the courage
gone out of him as it seemed, and broke down utterly.
He leant his arm against a tree, and his head on his
arm, and wept as though his heart would break; I
trembled to see how the great sobs shook and rent him.
I stood wringing my hands, and pleading with him in
whispers to be calm, even while at the same time I
was so shaken myself that I could scarcely get out the
words. When presently that fit of despair had passed,
he spoke to me like a man suddenly grown old.</p>

<p>"I shall go to London to find her," he said slowly.
"If he has harmed her, then by the mother that
bore us both I'll kill him. Life can be nothing to me
then, and I shall not mind what happens. Look at
that hand, Tinman"&mdash;he stretched it out before him,
and I saw that it was still and steady as a rock&mdash;"and
take note that I do not speak in any boyish anger. If
he has harmed her, it will be worse than if he had
killed her, for he will have killed her soul; it'll be a
small vengeance to kill his body. Don't try to stop me;
I shall know where to find him in London."</p>

<p>He sprang out on to the road, and set off at a great
pace towards the town. For a few moments I strove
to keep up with him, trotting by his side, and pleading
brokenly with him that he would at least take time to
think. But he paid no heed to anything I said; he
walked straight on, staring in front of him with that
set deadly look in his eyes. And after a time I was
compelled from sheer exhaustion to drop behind, and
to see him go on steadily before me until he was lost to
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>I walked on feebly for a little time, perhaps with some
faint hope that he might repent of his purpose, and
turn back. Presently on the road before me I saw a
man standing, and for a moment the wild hope sprang
up in my mind that this was Arnold Millard, already
hesitating; as I ran up to him, however, I saw that it
was Fanshawe, who had evidently run himself to a
standstill. He was muttering to himself like one
possessed, laughing and trembling, and standing still
to look about him and to listen. As I went up to him
he took me by the arm, and spoke again those mad
words he had used in the grounds of the house.</p>

<p>"The dead come alive, Charlie," he whispered. "As
I hope for Heaven, I saw the face&mdash;there&mdash;going past
me like a face in a dream. I saw her, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked, with my mind full of something
else.</p>

<p>"Barbara," he whispered. "Not the child&mdash;but
<i>your</i> Barbara&mdash;<i>my</i> Barbara! She went past me like
a spirit!"</p>

<p>Horrified at the mere thought, I clapped my hand
upon his lips, and looked about me fearfully; for all at
once it seemed almost possible that on that night of
disaster the spirit of the dead woman might have
come back, in the vain hope to save her child. I
shuddered in the wintry wind that swept about us both
on the deserted road; I peered into the shadows, awed
and afraid.</p>

<p>"Fool!" I muttered savagely, to hide my own
fears. "You don't know what you're talking about.
It's the new Barbara&mdash;the child&mdash;about which we're
concerned to-night. She's gone."</p>

<p>"And the old Barbara come back," he said; and
stood there shuddering, with his face hidden in his
hands.</p>

<p>I left him, and went back towards the house. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
seemed as though I was shaken to my very soul, as
though something mysterious and wonderful was in
the very air itself, threatening me. I pushed open
the gate leading into the grounds, and peered in, like a
little child afraid of the dark; then I went in, picking
my way cautiously through the ruined and neglected
garden, with my eyes fixed upon the terrace. Coming
to it, I crept among the shadows, and peered in.</p>

<p>Murray Olivant was no longer there; but in his
usual chair, with the decanter and a glass beside him,
sat Lucas Savell in the lighted room in a heavy
slumber. And once again from that opposite end of
the terrace I saw the shadowy woman creep forward,
and look into the room. With my very hair rising, as
it seemed, and my limbs trembling, I took a step
towards her, and called her name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Barbara!"</p>

<p>After a moment she came slowly towards me, and
by the light that came from the room I looked into her
eyes. Then with a great cry I fell at her feet, feeling
that I held in mine warm hands of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>"Barbara!"</p>

<p>"I've come back&mdash;my dear&mdash;my dear&mdash;to save my
child," said the voice of the Barbara I had loved and
lost twenty years before.</p>

<p>Inside the lighted room the man whose name she bore
started, and shook himself, and fell asleep again; outside
in the cold and the darkness I knelt at the feet of
the woman I loved, and bowed my face upon her hands,
as I had done twenty years before in the same spot.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />

<a name="NEWS_OF_THE_PRISONER" id="NEWS_OF_THE_PRISONER">NEWS OF THE PRISONER</a></h3>


<p>In some unreal dream, as it seemed, I presently
found myself walking through the ruined garden
in the darkness, with that shadowy figure of the woman
I had loved beside me. It was a shadowy figure then,
because there seemed to be nothing tangible about her;
I should scarcely have been surprised if she had suddenly
melted again into the shadows of the garden, and
been lost to me. I found myself, broken trembling
creature that I was, walking beside her fearfully, and
seizing an opportunity now and then to touch her dress
or her hand, to be sure that I was not dreaming. And
presently it happened, happily and naturally enough,
that we walked out of the place under the winter moonlight
hand in hand.</p>

<p>I would not have you laugh at us; I would not have
you think that we were old. True, I was old, in the
sense that I was broken and forlorn and poor, with
no one in the world to cling to, except this dear woman
who had so mysteriously come back to me. So intangible
had been my dreams of her at all times, that
there was less of a shock to me in finding her grown
older than I should have thought possible. I had
pictured her always, first as being of the age I had
known her as a girl, and later as having died young,
and never having grown to womanhood at all. But
now, as she walked beside me, I found, when I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
courage to steal a glance at her now and then, that she
had the eyes of the Barbara of old, and that the face,
though changed and strengthened, was only the face
of the Barbara I had loved in all its lines and in all its
maturer beauty. It seemed fitting, too, that we should
meet like this, with the night and the silence to ourselves;
fitting that we should turn naturally towards
that wood in which we had met, and presently sit
down there, side by side, on a fallen tree to talk. Such
poor forlorn lovers we were, that I remember regretting
I had no overcoat that I could put about her; and
she laughing, in the way I remembered so well, and
telling me that it did not matter.</p>

<p>My head was bare after my escape from the house
by the window; I remember that she touched my grey
hair softly with her hand for a moment before she
began to speak.</p>

<p>"My dear, I came first to the prison on the day that
I knew you were to be released; I had seen it mentioned
in a newspaper. But I was too late; you had
already gone. And I had waited so many years, in the
hope that I might take your hand, and be the first to
give you welcome back to the world."</p>

<p>"But they told me you were dead," I whispered.
"They said you had&mdash;had died at sea."</p>

<p>"When I came to you for the last time, in that
dreadful place where they were to kill you the next
day, I strove hard to keep your brave words clearly
before me, and to do what you had begged me to do.
It was as though you had died young, and so had
ended the poor broken story of our loves; so at least I
told myself. I would not have you think, my dear,
that I was callous; but you had lain down your life,
and I could serve you best, and serve your memory
best, by taking up mine as you would have had me
live it. So I went away with my husband out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the world, and I strove hard to set aside all my
memories, and all my hopes, and all my wishes; I was
as a numbed thing, existing only, and striving to forget."</p>

<p>I looked into her eyes, and I held her hands; and it
seemed as though the broken useless years dropped
away from me, and that I sat there that night, cleansed
and purified; I would not have changed places with
any one in all the world. I had not a coin in my pocket,
nor a friend in the world save this woman as forlorn as
myself; but I would not have changed places with
any man living that night.</p>

<p>"I heard, of course, that you were reprieved," she
went on; "and although I was glad to feel that you
still lived, it hurt me most to think that you, who
loved the sun and the free air and the woods, were
condemned to that death in life. But I strove always
to keep my promise to you, and long after my child
was born I lived with my husband, and took up my
dull round of daily tasks. But by degrees a change
came over Lucas Savell; he grew morose and distrustful,
and only long afterwards did I understand
what had changed him."</p>

<p>"What was it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"When my father prosecuted your guardian, Jervis
Fanshawe, I think he heard something about the poor
innocent love story that had been ours. I think
Fanshawe poisoned his mind and I believe my father
breathed something of his suspicions to Lucas Savell.
From that time he began to treat me badly, with little
petty acts of tyranny at first, and then with open slights
and small degradations, until at last my health broke
down. I think he became a little frightened, and at
the urgent request of the doctors he took me away on
a sea voyage with the child."</p>

<p>"But from that sea voyage you never returned," I
reminded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, be patient, and listen," she urged gently.
"On that long voyage it seemed to me that life, as I
had once hoped to live it, came back to me; in the
long watches of the night, when I could not sleep, I
thought of you in your prison, and my life seemed a
thing shameful and horrible. I remembered your
gentleness; even in the prison garb in which I sometimes
thought of you, you stood before me always as a
king&mdash;strong and self-sacrificing and wonderful. Because
a man had dared to speak ill of me, you had gone
out, without a thought of the consequences, and struck
him dead; there was no man I'd ever met who would
have done half so much for me."</p>

<p>I thought of a boy who was even then setting out to
do the same thing again; I shuddered as I sat there.</p>

<p>"At last one night the thing had become intolerable
to me," she went on, in a whisper that grew sharp and
eager as she remembered that time. "I made up my
mind that I could no longer live the life I was living;
I must get away somewhere, and hide myself; I must,
if possible, begin again. It seemed to me, my dear,
as though your sacrifice had been in vain; I must
consecrate what was left of my life to you, and to the
memory of you. We were in mid-ocean&mdash;but I made
up my mind to escape."</p>

<p>"How did you do it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There was a stewardess on board&mdash;a strong, stern,
repressed woman, whose confidence I had gained, and
who seemed to be deeply interested in me. I told her
just so much of my story as was necessary; I swore to
her that I could not and would not meet the man whose
name I bore again. I told her that I would, if necessary,
fling myself into the sea rather than endure his
presence any longer. And she showed me a better and
a simpler way, yet a harder way to bear."</p>

<p>She sat for a moment or two with her elbows on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
knees, leaning forward, and evidently thinking deeply;
I did not dare to interrupt her. I stole a hand into
hers, and she clasped my hand between her own, and
so held it while she went on talking.</p>

<p>"At her suggestion I left a note for my husband,
telling him that I was tired of my life, and that I meant
to end it; I implored him to be good to the child. I
left the note in our cabin, and I stole out, when all the
ship except those on watch above was asleep, and met
my friend the stewardess. She took charge of me; and
she locked me into a tiny second-class cabin that had
before been empty. And for the remainder of that
voyage she tended me, and brought me food, and kept
me hidden."</p>

<p>"And your husband&mdash;Lucas Savell? What of
him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"After the first shock I do not think he cared very
much," she replied. "We had lived very unhappily;
perhaps he saw in this a release. I was told by the
stewardess that the ship was searched; but she managed
to put them off the scent, as far as my hiding-place
was concerned&mdash;smuggled me into her own quarters
while the search was going on. When we reached the
end of the voyage she lent me clothes and a heavy veil,
and I walked out unnoticed among the crowd of passengers
and the other crowd that had come to meet
them. I landed in England a free woman, and I began
again, under another name."</p>

<p>"And what was that other name?" I asked.</p>

<p>She laughed softly, and coloured like a girl. "Barbara
Avaline," she replied. Then more quickly she
added: "I would not have you think that I took that
name merely for a whim; it was because I loved you,
and because I felt that in spirit at least I belonged to
you. I have lived quietly, and not unhappily; I had
my memories to sustain me. The hardest part had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
been, of course, the giving up of little Barbara; I
almost failed in my purpose once or twice&mdash;almost
went back to Savell for the sake of the child. But,
thank God, I was able in all those long years to get news
of her; I have been near her many and many a time&mdash;poor
unhappy mother that I was!&mdash;and have known
that she was well. I have had to work for my living,
but that has not mattered; I might have gone mad
if I had not had something to do."</p>

<p>"And what first brought you down here?" I asked
after a pause, during which it seemed as though we
sat together looking into the past.</p>

<p>"My father had left the business to Lucas Savell, but
it was never any good in his hands. It went down
and down, and I knew that Savell was borrowing
money anywhere and everywhere. After a time they
got quite poor&mdash;Barbara and her father&mdash;and I began to
see a number of people gathering about the place, just
as they say birds of prey gather when a man is dying
and his hours are numbered. I did not think of Savell;
I thought only of Barbara and of what might happen to
her. And so, in a poor futile way, I've haunted this
place, and watched her&mdash;even hungered for her more
than I dare say."</p>

<p>"Where are you living?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"I have a couple of rooms at a cottage on the outskirts
of the town," she said, "and I do needlework for a living.
I lie hidden all day, and only come out like this when
the darkness has fallen. And to think that I have seen
you here before, and did not guess who you were."</p>

<p>"I am so changed," I reminded her sadly.</p>

<p>"I might have known that you would steal back to
the place where for an hour or two we were happy;
I might have guessed that. I have seen you once or
twice about the house and the grounds, and wondered
a little who you were, and why I was so strongly moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
at the sight of you. But we must not think any more
of ourselves," she went on eagerly&mdash;"we must
think of those who have grown up to take our
places."</p>

<p>"They have grown up to take our places indeed," I
said. "The new Barbara rises up in your image, to
find herself hopelessly in love with a boy who may be
something like myself twenty years ago; like myself,
the boy has no chance, from a worldly point of view.
Some strange fate has cast us up here together, like
ghosts out of the past, and it is for us to help them.
That will be beautiful, Barbara, because in doing that
we may mend that broken love story that was our
own."</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, too," she replied. We had
risen to our feet, and she was looking at me earnestly.
"I saw Barbara go away to-night with a strange man:
I was watching in the garden. She went reluctantly;
I heard her question him as to whether he was sure of
this and that. Tell me what it meant."</p>

<p>"Danger for her&mdash;ruin for her, unless she can be
found," I replied. Then I told her rapidly of all that
had happened that night, and of the plot that was
afoot. She listened eagerly, questioning me on this
detail and on that, speaking especially about the boy,
and what attitude he would take in the business.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Barbara," I exclaimed in a whisper&mdash;"don't
you understand that he sets his feet to-night
absolutely in the footmarks that were mine twenty
years ago?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked quickly, catching
at my arm.</p>

<p>"Barbara, I set out twenty years ago to make a man
eat his words, or to kill the lie that he had told about
you. To-night this boy sets out on the same errand,
with a new Barbara&mdash;your child&mdash;to inspire him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
is to him as pure and precious a thing as you were to
me all those years ago. If he finds the man, he will
strike him down, as I struck down Gavin Hockley;
he will suffer as I suffered&mdash;although they may be more
merciful in his case, and may take his life. Think of it!"
I cried, wringing my hands as I stood there, bareheaded,
trembling and helpless in the winter night&mdash;"think of
it! I can do nothing, because I have no money and
no strength left; you can do nothing, because you
died to the world years ago, and at the best, even though
you lived, you are poor and helpless as I am. While
we stand here&mdash;two poor ghosts come back out of the
world that is dead&mdash;this boy and girl take up the tale,
and rush straight to disaster, just as we did."</p>

<p>"But we have come back to save her," she exclaimed
quickly. "This is no time for despair, Charlie; we
have a greater power given to us than you imagine. We
shall work in secret&mdash;you and I&mdash;and we shall succeed.
See now"&mdash;she held my hands, and looked into my
eyes, and smiled encouragingly&mdash;"you are calmer
already than you have been. It seems to me that the
best thing we can do is to get to London at the earliest
possible moment. Barbara has been taken there&mdash;the
boy has gone there; this man Murray Olivant will
inevitably follow. You know where he is to be found,
and we may be able to trace the boy. There is nothing
to be frightened of yet, Charlie; we will fight together,
because we understand so much more than these other
people do."</p>

<p>She was so wise and calm that she seemed to give
me wisdom too. I presently found myself walking
beside her back towards the town; it was her intention
to shelter me for the night at that tiny cottage where
she lived near Hammerstone Market. She had a key
to the place, and we crept in silently; she gave me some
poor food she had there, and insisted that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
stretch my weary limbs on an old couch in the sitting-room
for the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>I slept heavily, and long before dawn, as it seemed,
I found her standing beside me, gently waking me.
She had prepared some steaming hot coffee, and I
drank it gratefully, while she sat beside me and told
me what I was to do.</p>

<p>"This man Murray Olivant still feels that you may
be useful to him," she said; "in any case, you know
too much about his plans to be lightly thrown aside. I
have money here that will take you to London; you
will go to those rooms where Fanshawe first took you,
and you will wait there for Olivant. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>I said that I did, and that I would do all she suggested.</p>

<p>"Two things you have to remember," went on the
calm voice. "The first, that the boy must be prevented,
at the present time at least, from meeting
Olivant; I shudder to think what might happen if they
met now. Persuade Olivant to get away&mdash;to hide&mdash;anything.
The second is to get hold of poor Barbara,
and to bring her back to her father, if by any chance
we do not find young Millard. It may happen that, if
Olivant is frightened of what may befall him if the boy
finds him, he may throw up the game, and get out of
the way; then our course is clear. But in any case,
Charlie, we must not travel together. You will go
first, and I will come afterwards; we can arrange some
place in which to meet in London."</p>

<p>She knew as little about London as I did; therefore
she chose the first public place she could think
of for our later meeting. I was to find her on one
of the seats on the north side of Trafalgar Square,
just under the terrace; it was the only place we could
think of in the hurry of the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>I found that she had thought of everything; she
had even bought an old discarded brown wideawake
hat from her landlady for me, and had found out at
what time the earliest train started for London. With
a little money in my pocket I set off eagerly enough
on my mission. I felt more hopeful than I had for
many days past; I somehow felt that together we
must succeed.</p>

<p>It was cold and raw, and there was a biting wind.
There were but few people on the platform, and those
for the most part were market folk going to intervening
stations. I looked eagerly about, wondering
if by any chance Murray Olivant had made up his
mind to travel so early as that; but I saw nothing
of him. Evidently he was so sure of the plans he
had laid that he was not going to trouble himself to
turn out on such a bitter morning, or to hurry to
London.</p>

<p>I went straight to his rooms on reaching London,
only to be told by the manservant that he was not
there, and was not expected; indeed, the man seemed
somewhat astonished at seeing me at all. I evaded
his questions, and came away; turned back to deliver
a message to the effect that if Mr. Murray Olivant
came to the place, the man would beg him to stay
until I came again; I had news for him of vital importance.
Then I went away, and roamed the streets
in the bitter weather, pursued and haunted by a
thousand doubts and fears. And so back again
to the rooms of Murray Olivant&mdash;to see the boy Arnold
Millard pacing up and down outside, and keeping
watch upon them.</p>

<p>I seemed to see myself again, twenty years before,
raging up and down the pavement of Lincoln's Inn
Fields, waiting for the man I was to kill!</p>

<p>I was afraid to go to him, or to let him know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
I was there, because I feared lest he might think I
was on the side of the enemy, fighting against him
and the girl. And yet I was afraid, too, that Murray
Olivant might at any moment come swinging into
the street, and find himself face to face with the
boy who had sworn to kill him. Keeping that borrowed
hat well down over my brows, I set about to
find Olivant, guessing pretty well which way he would
come. I went to the end of the street, and presently
saw a cab driving fast in the direction of Olivant's
rooms; in the cab was the man I sought.</p>

<p>I ran along beside it, and called to Olivant excitedly.
He threw up the trap in the roof, and told the man
to stop; leaned out over the apron to speak to me.</p>

<p>"Hullo, friend Tinman," he said genially, "where
have you sprung from? And who let you loose
from the house?"</p>

<p>"There's danger&mdash;great danger," I panted, standing
on the step of the cab and whispering to him. "Everything
has come out; young Mr. Millard is waiting
there up the street&mdash;has been waiting there for hours."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what of it?" he asked; but I thought
his face went suddenly pale.</p>

<p>"He swears that he will kill you, and he means
to do it," I said.</p>

<p>Something of my own excitement seemed to communicate
itself to Olivant; he became suddenly
serious. Thrusting open the doors of the cab, he
caught up the bag that was beside him on the seat,
and got out. He paid the cabman, and then handed
me the bag. "Come along," he said quickly; "there's
another way into the place down this side street.
We can't stand talking here."</p>

<p>So we gained his rooms in that secret fashion;
and the moment we entered the manservant began
to explain to him that Mr. Arnold Millard had called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and would call again. Olivant cut him short quickly.
"There&mdash;that'll do; I know all about it," he said.
"Understand that no one is to be admitted; I have
not yet returned from the country. Any one who
comes can leave a message."</p>

<p>He seemed curiously perturbed, I thought; he
did not even refer at first to my own escape, or to
the fact of my being in London so strangely. He
went to a window, and pulled aside a curtain, and
looked out; turned away with an exclamation, and
looked at me. "How long has he been there?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"As I have told you&mdash;some hours," I said.</p>

<p>He went to the sideboard, and poured some neat
spirits into a glass, and drained it. Then he came
back to me, and, after a moment's hesitation, began
to question me.</p>

<p>"Now, in the first place, how did he connect me
with the business?"</p>

<p>"I told him," I replied simply. "I had to tell
him&mdash;I meant to tell him, for the sake of the girl."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Facing-Both-Ways, then what brings
you here? You tell the boy where to find me, and
then come skulking with your tail between your
legs to warn me. I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"I wanted to save the girl," I answered fearlessly.
"Don't you understand that he was to wait in a
certain place, until I came to him, bringing the girl;
he would have waited there for a time, and then
have come to the house to find me? And don't you
understand," I cried passionately, "that I'm not
fighting for you now, but for him?"</p>

<p>He turned to me quickly; looked at me curiously.
"Fighting for him?"</p>

<p>In the tense stillness of the room, as we looked
into each other's eyes, it almost seemed to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
I could hear the echoing footsteps of the boy pacing
up and down outside&mdash;waiting, with murder in his
heart. My own heart was beating madly; I could
scarcely get out the words I uttered.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;fighting for him," I whispered&mdash;"won't
you understand that? Twenty years ago a man
like you wronged a woman with his tongue, and
died because of that wrong. A boy&mdash;just such
another as the boy who walks up and down outside
there now&mdash;struck him dead, and stood under the
gallows for his crime. I was that boy; and he who
waits below is but myself, come back to life to do
what I did. I am not fighting for you&mdash;you are
nothing; I am here to-night to save the boy from
my fate. For as there is a God above us, he is here
to kill you!"</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a moment or two,
and then turned away. I saw him pull his handkerchief
from the sleeve of his coat, and pass it once across
his forehead, and then rub his hands with it hard,
as though they were wet. Then, in the most matter-of-fact
way, he came back to me, and looked at me
steadily. His eyes were very bright&mdash;brighter and
darker in contrast with the pallor of his face.</p>

<p>"You're not lying to me?" he demanded, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"I am not lying."</p>

<p>"And I suppose it doesn't happen by chance that
you and this brother of mine are in league&mdash;and that
you are to terrorize me, and find out about the girl&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think in that case he would have
come to you and made his threat in person?" I
asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose he would," he admitted. "In
any case, I have to thank you for this; if you'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
have held your tongue, he might have thought
that the girl had run away, or that she wanted
nothing more to do with him; he might never have
connected me with the matter at all. And now,
having caught me here like a rat in a trap, I suppose
you think you can force me to do something, out
of fear? Well, you won't do that; because in this
unequal world it's the rich man that always scores
in the long run. That poor beggar cooling his heels
on the pavement outside may threaten as he likes;
I am safe enough. But I wish I'd tied you up a
little more securely, my friend," he added viciously.</p>

<p>"You can get out of this difficulty in a moment,"
I reminded him. "Say where the girl is, and produce
her to this boy unharmed, and you are safe."</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed violently. "I'll not be
threatened by him&mdash;I'll not be forced to do anything
against my will. I can snap my fingers at him. Besides,"
he added with a grin, "there's another reason.
I don't myself know where the girl is."</p>

<p>"But you sent her away with the man Dawkins,"
I exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>"Who was to bring her to London, and to let me
know where she was. And I haven't heard yet."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke I heard a sharp double knock
at the outer door. I think for a moment Olivant
imagined that this was but a ruse on the part of the
boy to get in; I saw him move quickly to the further
end of the room. But a moment later the manservant
came in with a small salver on which lay a letter.
Olivant, with almost a sigh of relief, picked it up
and turned it over.</p>

<p>"Talk of the devil," he muttered with a laugh,
and tore it open.</p>

<p>He seemed to read the thing through twice; and
as he read his face grew harder and harder. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
he turned to me, and spoke quietly, with something
of the air of a man who is driven into a corner, but
has set his back against the wall, and means to
fight.</p>

<p>"This is from friend Dawkins," he said. "He
tells me that he has brought the girl to London, and
has put her in safe hands; he thinks, however, that
he should have something for his trouble." He
broke off, and turned to the letter. "'I am not a
rich man,'" he read, "'and a small matter of five
hundred pounds would be extremely useful to me
just now. Didn't I mention this last night? Under
the circumstances, and for the sake of the young
lady, I think it better that you should know that I
want this sum in exchange for her address. She's
a dear girl, and quite worth it.'" He banged the
letter savagely with his fist, and began to pace about
the room, muttering to himself. "First one and
then another&mdash;this threat and that; what do you
all think I'm made of? So this dog thinks he'll
hold the girl to ransom, does he? Sends me an
address to which letters are to be forwarded." He
suddenly strode to the door, and opened it.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm going out to face them&mdash;this fellow who
threatens my life, and this other who threatens my
pocket. I won't skulk like a dog here, and let them
think I'm afraid of them."</p>

<p>I caught his arm, and strove to draw him back
into the room. "Don't do that!" I pleaded&mdash;"don't
do that!"</p>

<p>He came back into the room, and closed the door;
suddenly he began to laugh in a grim fashion, as
though he rather enjoyed the situation. "If I had
anybody in whom I could put any confidence," he
said, "I'd cheat them both yet. But you're not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
fighting for me&mdash;and you may be against me. If
Fanshawe were here, I might be able to do something;
Fanshawe's got a sort of deadly hatred of
this girl that would carry him to any lengths. I
wonder what is best to be done?"</p>

<p>Whatever he decided to do then he kept to himself;
after pacing about the room for a time he told me I
could go, and that if I came back to him on the following
day he might have news for me. His last words
to me as I left him were characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>"I'll beat you all yet&mdash;and I'll win my game!"
he said.</p>

<p>In the grey of a winter twilight I found Barbara
Savell&mdash;that older Barbara who had belonged to my
life&mdash;pacing about at the north side of Trafalgar Square.
We met&mdash;she full of eagerness and anxiety, I dejectedly
enough. I told her that I had failed, but that I had
hopes that I might yet find that other Barbara. She
told me that she had secured a little lodging in a
humble quarter, and told me where it was; I walked
with her to it, and left her there for the night. Then,
because I did not know what else to do, I went off
to that place in which I had stayed before with Jervis
Fanshawe&mdash;that shabby room in a shabby house
near the river. I was worn out and miserable when
I knocked at the door, and was admitted by the girl
Moggs.</p>

<p>"'Ullo!" she exclaimed, her face expanding in
a grin&mdash;"so you've come back, 'ave yer? The
other party 'asn't bin 'ere fer days an' days; but I
fink 'e's expected."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?" I asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"'Cos there's some one waitin' for 'im&mdash;pleasant
sort o' gent, wiv a smile that does yer 'eart good to
see. Real genel'man, mind you," she added, with
a confident nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he told you his name?" I asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yus. Name o' Dawkins," she replied.</p>

<p>I went scrambling and stumbling up the stairs;
behind me as I ran I heard the girl Moggs calling
to me, but I paid no heed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<a name="I_ASSIST_THE_ENEMY" id="I_ASSIST_THE_ENEMY">I ASSIST THE ENEMY</a></h3>


<p>As I came to the door of that shabby room in
which I knew the man Dawkins was, a great
trembling fell upon me, so that I hesitated, and was
afraid to go in. It was not fear for myself: I think
at that time I had no fear of anything; it was only
that I knew that I should not be able to control myself,
if I stood face to face with this creature who had
assisted Murray Olivant to secure the girl, and now
held her to be sold for a price. I stopped outside
the door, with my hands clenched, and with my
heart beating wildly.</p>

<p>The tumult of passion in me was stilled by the
girl, who had run hard after me up the stairs. I
felt her coarsened grubby little hand gripping mine;
slowly she drew me back away from the door.</p>

<p>"'Ere&mdash;pull yerself togevver," she whispered.
"Wot's wrong wiv yer?"</p>

<p>"If I go into that room I am afraid of what I may
do," I said, clutching at the girl, and staring at the
closed door. "I'm afraid of myself."</p>

<p>"Wot's 'e done?" she whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>"Nothing you'd understand," I said. "But oh,
Moggs&mdash;have you ever read or heard anywhere any
fairy tale, concerning some wonderful princess, shut
away in prison and left to pine, while her lover waited
in vain for her. Have you, Moggs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded quickly, and her face expanded into
a grin. "Yus&mdash;I did once," she whispered. "It
came 'ere with summink wrapped in it&mdash;bit of a
Christmas story, it was."</p>

<p>"There's a wonderful princess held prisoner by
that man," I whispered eagerly. "And he'll smile&mdash;and
smile&mdash;and I am powerless to do anything to
help. You wise little person&mdash;tell me what to do?"</p>

<p>She plunged her grubby hands into her hair, and
wrinkled up her face in thought; then she caught
at my hand again, and whispered a startling suggestion.
"Go in an' talk to 'im," she said, "an' keep yer
dander down. W'en 'e goes out presently, I'll foller
'im&mdash;an' if I don't come back knowin' w'ere she is,
my name ain't Moggs. Is she a real tiptopper?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful, and gentle, and good," I assured
her, as she listened unctuously.</p>

<p>"An' 'im wot's sweet on 'er&mdash;is 'e all right?"</p>

<p>"The best fellow in the world," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then this is just w'ere I come in!" exclaimed
the strange little creature. "I was born for this
'ere!"</p>

<p>I shook hands with her solemnly on the dark and
grimy staircase; and I blessed and thanked her.
Then I opened the door, and went into the room,
praying hard for strength to control myself. Dawkins
was sitting on the edge of the table, swinging one leg,
and smoking a cigar; he did not trouble to look round
as I entered, probably from the fact that he felt that
only one person could come into that room with
any assurance.</p>

<p>"Well, Fanshawe, it's taken you long enough to
get to London," he said, flicking the ash from his
cigar.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I said, "but it's not Mr.
Fanshawe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>He jumped off the table, and leant against it, staring
at me; I think it was the first time I had seen
his face without a smile upon it. "By George!"
he exclaimed, in a low voice&mdash;"I thought I'd tied
you up better than that!"</p>

<p>"I was so fortunate as to get away," I replied.
"I have seen my&mdash;my master, Mr. Olivant; he
knows all about my escape. I have just left him."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you've brought something for
me from him?" he exclaimed eagerly, with his
habitual smile breaking over his face.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Nothing," I said. "I did
not expect even to find you here."</p>

<p>"True; I'd forgotten that," he said, in a tone
of disappointment. "I suppose you came looking
for Fanshawe&mdash;eh? As a matter of fact, I want to
see Fanshawe myself."</p>

<p>I suddenly made up my mind that I would make
the attempt on my own part to find out something
about the girl; I might even be able to persuade
this man that he would get nothing from Murray
Olivant, and so induce him, out of revenge, to let
me know where Barbara was. After a moment's
hesitation I plunged into the business.</p>

<p>"When you left me tied up and gagged at the
house at Hammerstone Market," I began, "you
took away with you a young lady&mdash;Miss Barbara
Savell."</p>

<p>"And a deuced nice girl, too," exclaimed the man,
nodding his head and smiling. "You were nicely
diddled over that business, Tinman; and in turn I
diddled our friend Olivant. It's a pity that so charming
a young lady should be played catch-ball with
in this fashion; but that's her fault, because she is
so charming. Now, I suppose you've really been
sent by Olivant to spy out the land&mdash;eh? You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
as well let me know the truth, because I shall discover
it in any case. I'm much too wily for you
people."</p>

<p>"I tell you again that I did not imagine for a moment
you would be here," I reminded him. "Mr.
Olivant knows nothing of your whereabouts; he has
simply had your letter, giving an address to which
letters may be sent. But I assure you that you
will get nothing out of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you know <i>that</i>, do you?" he said with
a sneer. "Very well, I can afford to wait. The
young lady, though inclined to be troublesome and
fretful, is really very charming company."</p>

<p>"I want to believe, sir, that you're a gentleman,"
I went on again patiently.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he responded, smiling.</p>

<p>"And I want to appeal to your better nature. This
girl is friendless in the world, save for me and for the
boy who loves her; you have been fortunate enough
and wise enough to get her out of the hands of Murray
Olivant; give her into mine, and let me send her
back to her lover&mdash;or to her father."</p>

<p>Even as I made the appeal I realized the futility
of it. But I saw here that violence would not do,
and that he would scoff at any threatening; I had
felt at first, when I began to speak, that there was
a faint chance that I might move the man. As he
laughed and shook his head, I saw that I must, after
all, trust to that frail support&mdash;Moggs.</p>

<p>"My good man, it is quite refreshing to hear any one
talk as you do," he said. "You really appear to be
in earnest, and under other circumstances I might
almost be prepared to listen to you. But the prize
is too good to be lost, whether I get the money or
stick to the lady. Personally, I believe that Olivant
may be squeezed, and may decide that it is best for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
him to pay; but in any case I score. No, friend
Tinman, this is not a game with which you are concerned.
Mind your own business, and leave these
things to your betters. And as it seems that Fanshawe
is not coming, I think I'll return to the lady."</p>

<p>"And if I follow you?" I exclaimed, maddened
at the thought that he set me aside so lightly. "What
then?"</p>

<p>He struck a match, and relit his cigar; looking
at me over the smoke of it, he laughed, and shook
his head. "You're really very simple, Tinman,"
he said. "I don't believe for a moment that you
really take so deep an interest in the lady and her
lover; I am inclined to believe that you are a spy
from the camp of Mr. Murray Olivant. If you have
the audacity to follow me, I shall do one of two things:
I shall either go in a wrong direction, at some inconvenience
to myself; or I shall call the attention of
the first constable I meet to you, and inform him
that you have been begging from me, and threatening
me. You look shabby, Tinman, and you have a
bad record behind you, I understand. For your
own sake you'd better stay here."</p>

<p>At that time I had no very great faith in the powers
of Moggs; however eager she might be to throw
herself into the business, I felt that in all probability
this astute man of the world would prove more than
a match for her. It was with something very like
despair in my heart that I saw him saunter out of
the room. I ventured to the door the moment after
he had left the room, and opened it cautiously; he
was going down the stairs, and he stopped for a moment
to look back at me.</p>

<p>"You can tell Fanshawe that it doesn't matter,
after all; I'm not particularly anxious to see him.
And if you want the lady, Tinman&mdash;well&mdash;your master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Murray Olivant knows how to get her. Good-night
to you!"</p>

<p>I saw nothing of Moggs; I went back into the
room, and shut the door. It seemed at that time
as though all I had striven to do and all I had hoped
for had been brought to naught; I stood helpless
in this poor shabby room, staring about me, and
wondering what I should do. What power did I
possess&mdash;poor broken outcast, without even a name,
and assisted only by a little drab of the streets; what
could we do against such men as Olivant? I recognized,
now that it was too late, that I ought to have played
a different game; that I should have matched cunning
with cunning, and devilry with devilry; I had been
too blunt and outspoken. And then my thoughts
flew back to the boy, waiting doggedly outside the
rooms of the man who had set out to ruin him and
the girl he loved; and I saw the Fate that had dogged
and destroyed me marching grimly on over me,
and striking down young Arnold Millard. I had no
power to stay his hand; nor was there any power
behind such threats as I might use to Olivant and
the others.</p>

<p>I was like a man who stands in the dark, with three
or four roads stretching out from the point at which he
is, and uncertain in his own mind which to take. I
had thoughts of going to my Barbara, and making
her understand more completely even than she understood
yet the peril in which her child stood; but, on
the other hand, I knew that to do that would be useless
while the girl was still lost to us. Then I thought
of sending to Lucas Savell; but remembered what
manner of man he was, and how utterly useless he
would be in a crisis. It seemed monstrous that I
should stand here, helpless, in the midst of a great
city&mdash;unable to do anything; but I had to remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
bitterly enough, that I was a man with the brand of
Cain upon me, and a long prison record behind me;
more than that, I was known in London and elsewhere
as living under another name. It was all a horrible
tangle, from which it seemed impossible that we
should ever escape.</p>

<p>I heard a step upon the stairs&mdash;too heavy to be that
of Moggs; it was a jaded weary step, and it stopped
outside the door. I went to the door, and opened it;
outside a man stood, and as he thrust me aside and
came in I saw that it was Jervis Fanshawe. He
threw down a small untidy bundle on to the bed, and
tossed his hat after it, and sank into a chair.</p>

<p>"Give me something to drink," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>I found something, and gave it to him; he drank
it greedily, looking at me as he did so with a curious
expression in his eyes. Once he made up his mind
to speak; but he stopped, even as he opened his
lips, and half rose in his chair, staring hard at the
door. He did not look at me; his voice was a mere
shaking whisper.</p>

<p>"There's some one on the stairs!" Then, as I
moved quickly to the door, he sprang up and confronted
me, and pressed me back; and his face was
like death itself. "No&mdash;no&mdash;don't open the door.
I know what it is, and I couldn't bear to see it again."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" I faltered, "what
have you seen; what's happened to you?"</p>

<p>He did not reply; with a trembling hand he poured
out some more of the liquor, and drank it; and even
then, as he did so, he paused to listen again with
that curious intentness. Finally he got over to the
further end of the room, and then pointed to the door,
and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open it now, Charlie&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>I confess I was as much shaken as he seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
be; I pulled open the door, however, and looked out.
There was no one there, and I told him so as I closed
it again.</p>

<p>"Last night in the garden&mdash;while you ran and called
to something or some one&mdash;I saw her," he said in a
whisper. "I told you then it was the dead come
alive; I tell you so again now, Charlie. To-night in
London, as I tramped through the streets (and I swear
I was not thinking of her in any way), I saw her face
pass me again&mdash;it was as though there was some strange
light upon it, that never was on this earth. Before
God, Charlie, she's come back; as I live, she means to
haunt me and to follow me!"</p>

<p>I saw in a moment what had happened. The
face of that elder Barbara, as he had seen it for a
moment, had been to him the face of the woman he
believed to be dead; his further meeting her in London
had been a mere accident. I hesitated to tell him the
truth: that this woman was alive. I did not know
how much further I might be complicating matters,
or what greater difficulties I might be creating. For
the present, at least, I determined to hold my tongue,
and to let him think what he would. He went on
with his rambling talk.</p>

<p>"I've heard of men being driven mad like that,"
he said; "I've heard that some one, deeply wronged,
may come back from the grave, to work a more bitter
vengeance than they could have done in life. Is
there any truth in that, Charlie?"</p>

<p>I began to see that this better mood might be useful;
that this implacable creature, who had pursued his
vengeance so relentlessly and so long, might perhaps
be turned a little from his purpose if he supposed that
the spirit of the dead woman was following him, to
take account of what he was doing. His next words
confirmed that impression in my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I helped Olivant and Dawkins last night and
yesterday over that matter of the girl; spied out the
land for them, and told them where you were, and
what you were doing. I meant all along to drag the
girl down, as I meant years ago to drag down the
mother: she had her mother's look, and her mother's
voice, and I hated her for them. But I'm afraid,
Charlie; I find myself starting at shadows. You
saw her last night in the garden; I heard you call to
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw her," I replied steadily.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, and looked again at the door
with that hunted look his face had worn before. "I
knew it; that proves it," he said. "I'm getting an
old man, Charlie, and still my vengeance has brought
me nothing but this: that I sit in this place, with no
soul on God's earth to speak a good word for me, and
with the knowledge that I may have wrecked the lives
of two women. There's hell for me, Charlie, and
that dead woman will fling me down to it!"</p>

<p>It was in my mind then, in sheer pity for the hunted
wretch, to tell him the truth. But I saw in a moment
that if I did that he would understand that he had
been robbed of his vengeance from the very start, and
had brought himself to his present pass for nothing; for
the woman he had pursued was living still. I understood
that in that case I should make him a more
bitter enemy to the mother and the girl than ever,
out of sheer rage at having been duped so long. And
in any case I had seen enough of him to know that I
could not trust him. And out of his fright some good
might come.</p>

<p>That fright was indeed so great that when, a moment
later, a hand was laid upon the door, and it opened
cautiously, the man started up, with something very
like a shriek. But it was nothing more than Moggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
untidy and slipshod as ever; she gave me a quick
glance as she came in, and my heart gave a leap, for
I seemed to read in it that she had succeeded. However,
she merely muttered something about the fire,
and went across the room to attend to it. Kneeling
there, she began to croon to herself that strange weird
song that had no tune nor time to it, and which I had
heard her sing before.</p>

<p>I was casting about in my mind for some means of
speaking to her alone, without arousing Fanshawe's
suspicions, or at least of getting rid of Fanshawe for a
few moments, when the girl solved the difficulty for
herself, and that too in the quaintest fashion. She
suddenly looked up at me, with a queer smile on her
face, and spoke.</p>

<p>"You know about that there princess you was
talkin' of, guv'nor, don't yer?" she asked; then,
without waiting for a reply, went on demurely enough:
"I dunno' but wot I 'aven't worked out that story
in me own way, after all."</p>

<p>"How's that, Moggs?"</p>

<p>"Can't that girl cease her chatter, and go?" demanded
Fanshawe angrily, as he cast himself down on
his bed, and lay there with his hands clasped under
his head.</p>

<p>"'Alf a tick, guv'nor, 'alf a tick," remonstrated
Moggs, turning to him; then she looked back at me.
"Wot if you was to 'ear that the princess was fetched
away by a ugly sort o' fairy&mdash;smuggled out, in a manner
o' speakin'&mdash;an' brought to that ugly fairy's place,"
the thin cracked voice was growing excited&mdash;"an'
'id away by 'er&mdash;eh? Wot then? Serpose the princess
crep' up the stairs without nobody seein' 'er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In my excitement I forgot everything; I suddenly
seized the girl by the shoulder, and shook her, and
cried out in my great relief: "Here, Moggs?&mdash;here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in this house? How did you manage it? Where
is she?"</p>

<p>Too late I saw that Fanshawe had raised himself on
one elbow on the bed, and was staring at me and at
the girl. I checked myself at once, and began haltingly
to change the talk, so that it might seem I was speaking
of something with which he was not concerned; but
he brushed such pretence aside impatiently, and demanded
to know what was happening.</p>

<p>"You've heard something&mdash;discovered something?"
he said suddenly, sitting upright, and turning his
haggard face towards me. "Oh!&mdash;don't shrink away;
from to-night I tell you I am your friend, hand and
glove with you in this business. I tell you I'm afraid;
I dare not go on. Give me a chance," he pleaded,
"and I'll undo all that I have done. You can't stand
alone in this, Charlie; give me the chance to help you."</p>

<p>"You can't; you are ranged on the other side," I
said sternly.</p>

<p>"I am not&mdash;I am not!" he exclaimed. "Don't
I tell you that I'm afraid&mdash;that I dare not go on any
further? Moggs"&mdash;he turned quickly to the girl,
and spoke appealingly&mdash;"tell me where she is; you
may trust me."</p>

<p>"I ain't so sure abaht that," said Moggs, looking
from him to me, and back again. "More'n that,"
she added with cunning, "I ain't quite sure that I
know what you're talkin' about." She walked to
the door, giving me a sharp glance as she went, as
though to bespeak my attention. With what carelessness
I could muster I went after her; as I glanced
back into the room I saw that Fanshawe, still raised
on his elbow, was looking after me hungrily.</p>

<p>Outside on the dark landing it was a mere matter
of excited whispers. "You've got her here&mdash;safe?"
I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Safe as twenty 'ouses!" she replied. "I waited
abaht in the street until I sees me gentleman come
out; arter that I never lost sight of 'im. The place
wasn't so far from 'ere, arter all, an' it wasn't likely
'e was goin' to take no notice of anybody like me.
I watched him go in, I seed 'im come out again. A
minute later I was ringin' the bell, as innercent as yer
please; an' there was a young person employed same
as me in the 'ouse; I could talk to 'er in wot you might
call me own language&mdash;found she was actually at
the same Board School as wot I was. In less'n a
minute we was talkin' friendly; five minutes arterwards
I was upstairs, wiv the key turned in the
lock, an' the young lady listenin' to wot I'd got to
say."</p>

<p>"Dear, sweet Moggs!" I exclaimed in a whisper.
"And she came with you at once?"</p>

<p>"That instant minute," said Moggs. "I mentioned
who you was, an' that you was waitin' for 'er; it seemed
that she'd on'y bin persuaded to stop there, believin'
that the young gent was comin' any minute. Now
she's in my room&mdash;right at the top, under the tiles&mdash;as
safe as safe. Oh, I tell yer, it wants a woman for this
work!"</p>

<p>I shook the diminutive creature's hand; I was just
about to break out into some further expressions of
gratitude, when her eyes warned me that we had a
listener. I turned swiftly, in time to see a line of light
down the edge of the door of the room&mdash;a line that was
gradually narrowing, until it disappeared altogether
as the door was closed. I understood at once that
Jervis Fanshawe had been listening to all that had
been said.</p>

<p>"It's all right," I assured her quickly. "I think
he's our friend; in any case I can keep him silent.
Go up and see Miss Savell; tell her that I'm near at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
hand, and that I will come up to her the moment I
can slip away."</p>

<p>Moggs disappeared instantly, and I opened the
door and went into the room. Fanshawe was seated
on the side of the bed, with his hands pressed together
between his knees, rocking himself slowly backwards
and forwards. He seemed strangely excited, but I
hardly noticed that at the time, in my indignation
that he should have played the spy upon me.</p>

<p>"Why did you listen?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why won't you trust me, Charlie?" He looked
up at me, and there was again in his eyes that fear I
had seen before. "I know that all I have done gives
the lie to what I want to do; but I am sincere now,
because I'm afraid. Won't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"There is no necessity for me to trust any one,"
I replied. "I don't know how much you know, or
how much you don't; but I want to tell you this:
it'll go hard with any one who tries again to defeat
what I am trying to do. I've got my chance now to
upset all the plans that you and those connected with
you have made; for your own sake you'd better keep
out of it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with her? What do
you think you can do&mdash;you who are poor and weak and
alone; what hope have you of fighting against richer
men? I tell you you'll come to grief, and I shall
walk for ever with the shadow of the dead Barbara
by my side. I know it&mdash;I know it!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it is a matter that does not concern
you," I said again. "Why should you expect me to
trust to you&mdash;you whose long life has been a lie from
beginning to end? Keep out of it, I tell you; it will
go hard with you if you play me any tricks again."</p>

<p>I left him sitting in that dejected attitude; I
heard him muttering again and again that I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and I would not understand! I opened the door,
and went out on to the staircase, meaning to see the
girl Barbara, and to reassure her as to her safety. But
while I stood there for a moment I heard voices down
below, voices that I knew.</p>

<p>"I tell you you can't deceive me&mdash;an' you won't
deceive me." It was the voice of Murray Olivant,
loud and aggressive. And the voice of Dawkins
replied to him.</p>

<p>"I tell you the girl has been spirited away. I've
come here now in the hope of hearing something about
her; perhaps that rascally servant of yours knows
something&mdash;the fellow Tinman. On my solemn word,
Olivant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet!"</p>

<p>I slipped back into the room to wait for them.
Murray Olivant strode in first, and looked at me with
a scowl; looked past me at Jervis Fanshawe, who had
risen from the bed. "Well&mdash;plotters and schemers&mdash;what's
the move now?" he demanded. "Is there
any one here at all I can believe or trust?" He
looked round on the three of us fiercely enough.
"Dawkins here has her, and then he has not; you,
Fanshawe, can do great things, but you don't do them;
Tinman threatens and boasts, and does nothing. I
suppose you think you can play with me just as you
please, eh? Will no one speak?"</p>

<p>"I tell you again, Olivant, that I have not got the
girl," said Dawkins. "I only came here in the hope
to find her; I've been tricked, just as I tried to trick
you. If I knew where she was, shouldn't I try to
bluff the thing a bit, and get some money out of
you?"</p>

<p>"I believe you would," retorted Olivant slowly.
Then he swung round to me. "Well, Tinman, and
what do you know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied. "I have not seen the lady
at all."</p>

<p>"Why should she come here?" asked Fanshawe,
in a quiet voice. I confess I had been expecting a
totally different answer from him, and I began to
wonder if, after all, I had misjudged the man. His
face was a mask, behind which even the deadly fear
that he had shown was hidden.</p>

<p>"Well, I trust <i>you</i>, at any rate, Fanshawe," said
Olivant, "because I believe you know who's your
friend, and who's likely to help you most in this world.
This seems to rest with you, Dawkins," he went on,
turning to his friend, "and I shan't forget to pay you
for it, though not quite in the coin you expected.
I'm going home; God help any one of you that plots
against me again. You, Tinman, can walk with me;
I believe you have some fears as to my safety," he
added, with a grin.</p>

<p>The man Dawkins came down the stairs and into the
street with us, still protesting his innocence in the
matter; Murray Olivant waved him aside impatiently
enough, and set off in the direction of his lodging.
I think he had meant to take me with him; but
within a hundred yards of the house he hailed a passing
cab, and turned to dismiss me.</p>

<p>"You can go back," he said. "I shan't want you.
You needn't be afraid; I shall go in the back way."
He climbed into the cab, and was rapidly driven away.</p>

<p>I walked slowly back to the house, and rang the bell
again. After I had climbed the stairs to Fanshawe's
room I suddenly made up my mind that I would go on
further, and see Barbara; altered my mind again, and
determined to see Fanshawe, and at least to thank him
for the attitude he had adopted to Murray Olivant. I
opened the door and went in, but the man was not there.</p>

<p>Inwardly perturbed, I came out on to the landing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
again, and began slowly to climb the stairs; I did
not like this sudden absence of Fanshawe in the least.
On the landing above I came face to face with Moggs,
standing outside a door, and looking at me with
a scared white face.</p>

<p>"She's gorn!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken," I exclaimed roughly,
with all my old suspicions sweeping in upon me like
a flood. "Where can she have gone to?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," whimpered the girl. "But I tell you
she's gorn."</p>

<p>I ran out of the house, scarcely knowing what I
meant to do. My thoughts turned naturally to the
man who had made up his mind to get hold of Barbara;
I determined to go to Murray Olivant at once. With
difficulty, for it was now very late, I got to the place;
and even then hesitated whether to go in or not. For
in the first place, if I came face to face with him I must
confess that I had lied, and that the girl had been in
that other house even while he visited it.</p>

<p>The matter was determined for me, after all. I had
got outside the rooms, and was standing there, hesitating
what to do, when a man stopped before me, and
spoke my name in a surprised voice. It was young
Arnold Millard.</p>

<p>"Tinman!" Then suddenly and eagerly&mdash;"Where's
your master?"</p>

<p>"Not there, sir," I replied quickly. "I&mdash;I don't
know where he is."</p>

<p>We were standing on the opposite side of the street;
he suddenly grasped my arm, and pointed. A window
had been opened up above, and leaning out from a
lighted room I saw for a moment the head and shoulders
of Murray Olivant. The head was withdrawn in a
moment, and the window closed and darkened, but
we had both seen it distinctly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not there?" exclaimed the boy derisively. "So
they've told me every time I've inquired. Hiding
from me, is he?"</p>

<p>He ran across the street, and I ran after him, calling
to him to stop. We both reached the stairs together,
and together rushed up them; and by that time I had
him by the arms, and was clinging to him, imploring
him to calm himself. The noise we made when we got
to the door of the flat alarmed that respectable manservant
inside; he opened the door a little way, and
we stumbled in together, brushed him aside, and rushed
pell-mell into the room where Murray Olivant stood.
And there was not only Olivant there, but the man
Dawkins and Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"I've found you at last," cried the boy excitedly.
"I want to know where Miss Barbara Savell is?"</p>

<p>Murray Olivant looked quickly round from one to
the other of us; saw me clinging to the boy, and whispering
to him&mdash;saw Dawkins and Fanshawe and the manservant.
Perhaps he felt that there was safety in
numbers; at all events, he retreated to the door of an
inner room, and spread his arms across it, as though to
guard it.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he cried roughly&mdash;"she's here!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />

<a name="I_KNOW_THE_WAY_AT_LAST" id="I_KNOW_THE_WAY_AT_LAST">I KNOW THE WAY AT LAST</a></h3>


<p>For a moment, after that astounding statement by
Murray Olivant, we stood transfixed, staring at
him as he spread his arms across the door and faced
us defiantly. I do not think that he had imagined
his words would have such an effect; our amazed
silence showed him in a moment that the game was
with him. In a limp fashion I was clinging to young
Millard, whose fury, as it seemed, had suddenly relaxed,
leaving him helpless.</p>

<p>"Here?" gasped the boy, in a sort of horrified
whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Olivant loudly. "Here&mdash;by her
own choice, and of her own free will. I suppose the
girl can choose for herself&mdash;and in this case, she has
chosen wisely. Like every one else in this world, she
knows on which side her bread is buttered. Now,
get out of my place," he added, advancing towards
us: "open the door there, you; show these people
out."</p>

<p>Young Arnold Millard seemed suddenly to recover
himself and his strength at the same time; I felt his
muscles hardening under my grip. Then, with an
inarticulate shout, he hurled himself straight at
Olivant; and in a moment was fighting madly
with Dawkins and myself to get at him. I remember
noticing even then that Fanshawe stood aside, wringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
his hands helplessly, and moistening his dry lips
with his tongue.</p>

<p>"Let me go! It's a lie&mdash;I know it's a lie! Let
me go!" shouted the boy, battling like a madman
with us.</p>

<p>The frightened manservant had run out of the
room, crying something as he went; it seemed an
incredibly short space of time before he came hurrying
in again, followed by a policeman. In a dexterous
fashion this latter contrived to get between the boy
and his enemy; interposed his solid official bulk between
them.</p>

<p>"Now then&mdash;now then, gentlemen!" he said quietly.
"What's the trouble here?"</p>

<p>Murray Olivant was the first to speak. "This
man has forced his way into my rooms, and has
threatened me," he said quickly. "I want him
removed."</p>

<p>The constable glanced from one to the other; his
face was impassive. "Do you know the man, sir?"</p>

<p>"He is a relative of mine&mdash;a ne'er-do-well, who has
given considerable trouble to his friends," said Olivant.
"He has been waiting outside in the street for some
hours, on the chance of getting hold of me. The
present dispute is about a lady."</p>

<p>"Constable, I demand to have these rooms searched;
I mean to prove that this man is lying!" cried the
boy excitedly. "He says&mdash;says the lady's here&mdash;and
it is a lie!"</p>

<p>"You'll understand, sir, that I've no power to
search this gentleman's rooms," said the constable;
"and I've no right to inquire into any dispute about
a lady or anything else. For your own sake, sir"&mdash;he
was talking in an easy argumentative fashion
to young Millard&mdash;"for your own sake, you'll go
away. If you stop here there'll only be a breach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the peace committed, and you'll get yourself into
my hands. If this don't blow over by the morning,
I'm much mistaken; in any case, you can't create
a disturbance here. Much better go away."</p>

<p>"I tell you I&mdash;&mdash;" He made a sudden leap to pass
the constable, and to reach the door of that inner
room; but the man was too quick for him: he
caught him by the arm, and deftly turned him towards
the door; hustled him out of the room into
the little hall. I was close at hand, and I heard what
the man said.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, you're behaving very foolish. Go
away, and go home and think about it; then see if
you don't thank me in the morning. Come on now."</p>

<p>I put in my plea also, and presently the boy went
away in a moody silence. The constable walked
quietly after him, and as I ran down too I saw the
man standing at the outer door leading into the street,
looking after the boy as he strode away.</p>

<p>"A bit hot-headed, your friend," he said. "Lor'
bless you, I've seen 'em like that a few times, and
then ready to laugh about it next morning."</p>

<p>I went back to the rooms; there I found the startled
manservant peering out at the door of the flat. He
drew me inside, and carefully closed the door: seemed
disposed, indeed, to question me.</p>

<p>"I give you my word I don't understand it," said
the man. "Because, you see, there's never been any
lady 'ere at all; an' nobody couldn't have got in
without passing me. Now, what I argue is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I thrust him aside, and walked into the room.
There I found Murray Olivant lying back in a chair,
shaking with laughter, while Dawkins and Jervis Fanshawe
stared at him wonderingly. Seeing me, he
sat up, and shook his head at me whimsically, and
went off into another shout of laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's beautiful!" he cried&mdash;"it's wonderful! It
only came to me on the spur of the moment to say
that she was here; I wanted to see if that young fool
would rise to the bait. And now he's gone off&mdash;and
he's a marked man; that constable's not likely to
let him come near me again in a hurry. Gone out
like a whipped cur, with his tail between his legs. It
was beautiful!"</p>

<p>"And he's left you with the girl," said Dawkins,
with his smile.</p>

<p>Murray Olivant sat up, and stared at him. "What&mdash;haven't
you tumbled to it yet?" he demanded.
"There's no girl here&mdash;and there never has been.
She'll come here sooner or later, no doubt; but she's
not here now."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, my dear Olivant, you can't bluff me,
you know," exclaimed Dawkins, beginning to show
a little temper over the business. "The girl's here
right enough."</p>

<p>"Open the door and look for yourself," said Olivant
composedly. "Personally, I wish I could say that
she had been here; but she hasn't."</p>

<p>Dawkins, after a glance at him, strode across the
room, and flung open the door; turned up the light,
and went poking and prying about. Fanshawe stood
at the door of that inner room, and peered in also.
Dawkins came out, and closed the door again.</p>

<p>"There are no other rooms," said Olivant, still
laughing&mdash;"except my servant's room across the
hall. You can go and look in there, if you like."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," replied Dawkins. "But hang
me if I thought it was a bluff to begin with&mdash;and
neither did the boy. More than that, I don't quite
see the object of it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you," said Olivant, with a note of
bitterness in his voice. "He's gone away now, eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
his heart out&mdash;mad with jealousy. If he meets
her to-morrow, and she holds out her arms to him,
he'll most likely turn away, and refuse to speak to her.
Love's a frail thing, and wants carefully nourishing.
Now get out, and leave me in peace," he added&mdash;"I'm
tired."</p>

<p>Dawkins went at once; I think he saw the futility
of attempting to speak to his patron about the matter
further at that time. Fanshawe and I were just
going also, when Murray Olivant, on a sudden impulse,
as it seemed, called us back.</p>

<p>"Just one moment; I want to speak to you," he
said. I noticed that a sudden seriousness had come
over him; even the cigar he had picked up, and from
which he had savagely wrenched the end with his
teeth, remained unlighted. "Which of you knows
anything about this young lady?"</p>

<p>"I don't," I replied at once, and looked at Fanshawe.
For in my mind I was certain then that Fanshawe
had in some way or other, after overhearing
the conversation between Moggs and myself, contrived
to get Barbara away. Nothing would persuade
me to trust the man.</p>

<p>"And you, Fanshawe?"</p>

<p>"What should I know about her?" was the nervous
reply. "What is she to do with me? You've
got to manage this business for yourself, Mr. Olivant;
it seems to me that your policy is to make other
people work for you, and give them nothing but
kicks in return. For my part, I wash my hands of
it."</p>

<p>I felt sure that he was lying; I was certain in my
own mind that he knew more than he would say. But,
of course, I could say nothing then.</p>

<p>"You're very silent, Tinman," said Murray Olivant
after a pause, during which we had stood helplessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
watching him. "What's your opinion of this night's
work?"</p>

<p>"My opinion is that Mr. Millard means to carry
out his first threat," I replied slowly. I saw him
look up at me, and the match he had lighted burned
down to his fingers, so that he dropped it hurriedly.
He made no attempt to light another.</p>

<p>"To kill me?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "I've seen him, as you haven't seen
him; and I know that his life is wrapped up in this
girl," I said earnestly. "He fears neither God nor
man in such a business as this&mdash;and he's gone away
to-night, believing that you have harmed her as you
threatened&mdash;believing that she is lost to him. He's
gone out to-night with murder in his heart. Don't
I know that look&mdash;haven't I seen it?"</p>

<p>He threw away that second match, and laid down
the cigar. After an uneasy pause he said slowly:
"Well&mdash;I know that&mdash;and I know you're right. He's
desperate, and perhaps with him I've gone a bit too
far."</p>

<p>"Ah!" My relief at hearing him say that must
have sounded in my voice, for he turned upon me
quickly, with a sudden new fierceness.</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand me. I've taken a wrong
move to-night, but I mean to take another and a
safer one. I'll not go back on what I mean to do;
I'll not knuckle under to a young cub like that. It
shall be as if the girl had really been here&mdash;only I'll
work in a more secret fashion. I have a love for
plotting and mystery; I'll leave that young fool
staring up at these windows for a few days, and eating
his heart out, and thirsting for my blood; and I'll
be comfortably slipping away elsewhere. You shall
help me, Tinman&mdash;and you too, Fanshawe&mdash;and I'll
promise you some sport."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I don't quite like the idea of
being kept prisoner here, under the fear of what may
happen if I venture outside. The boy's mad&mdash;but
it's a sort of madness from which he may only wake
when he has stuck a knife into me, or has done something
else that may bring him to the gallows. That's
too much of a risk for me; at the same time, I mean
to get the whip hand of him. You and Fanshawe
shall help me."</p>

<p>"Willingly&mdash;very willingly," said Fanshawe, speaking
mechanically, and not raising his eyes. "You
may trust us, Mr. Olivant; Tinman and I have no
life that is not concerned with you and your affairs.
But for you we must starve."</p>

<p>I looked at the despicable creature; I remembered
what he had said to me, and what he had promised that
very night; I was glad to think that I had not trusted
him. I thought he looked at me strangely, when for
a moment he raised his eyes to me; there was a look
in them I did not understand.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you recognize that fact," said
Murray Olivant, with a laugh. "That's been my
way always: to pay people to do things for me I
don't care to do myself. You can listen, then, to my
plans."</p>

<p>He was so exuberant about it, and chuckled so
much to himself at the thought of it, that it was some
time before he began to set it forth; and even then
he prefaced the business with a sudden generous
bringing out of bottles and glasses for our entertainment.
Fanshawe drank greedily, with many slavish
expressions of gratitude; I refused to take anything.
At last Murray Olivant, standing with his back to the
fire, and with a cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth,
began to say what was in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose that a certain man is threatened by
another&mdash;goes, in fact, in fear of his life from a madman;
and suppose that it is not convenient for him
to have that other arrested, or cautioned, or withheld
from what he means to do by the law. In
other words, he does not wish a certain fair lady's
name to be dragged into the light of day, and things
said about her. I have always been mighty sensitive
on such matters," he added complacently.</p>

<p>"You have indeed!" broke in Fanshawe, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Suppose I suddenly say that I am tired of the
whole business, and that I have made up my mind
to go abroad, and to leave these people in peace and
security," went on Olivant. "Suppose I decide to
take the faithful Tinman with me; suppose I even
go so far as to take tickets on a certain steamer for the
faithful Tinman and myself, and to publish the fact
abroad that I'm going. And then suppose, after
that, that I never go at all."</p>

<p>"But why not?" I asked helplessly; for I
did not see his drift.</p>

<p>"Dolt! Everybody is expecting that I have gone;
everybody knows that I have gone; and our young
friend Millard, who hasn't money enough to follow
me, and who has no reason for following me as I've
left the coast clear, is thrown off the scent. I slip
away quietly from this place, after sending a mountain
of luggage&mdash;or no luggage at all, if it pleases me;
and I go to an obscure lodging where no one thinks
of looking for me. And in due course, after the
vessel has sailed on which I am supposed to be, our
dear Fanshawe here&mdash;or our faithful Tinman&mdash;making
careful inquiries, discovers the lady, and brings her
to me. I'm abroad, and all suspicions are lulled; I
am at home, and am playing out to a finish the game
I started upon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw the fiendish ingenuity of the thing at once.
This man would publicly start off upon a voyage;
his name would be entered upon the list of passengers;
and he would quietly lie in hiding in London. The
boy would feel that his vengeance had been snatched
away from him; he would give up the battle in despair&mdash;only
to learn too late the trick that had been
played upon him. For my own part, I could do nothing;
because to warn Arnold Millard of that trick
would be but to put him more strongly and eagerly
on the track of his enemy. I was powerless; Olivant
and Fanshawe would play the game out to the end, and
I should have to look on, a helpless spectator. There
might be a faint chance that the girl would not be found
by either of them; on the other hand, I had a shrewd
suspicion that Fanshawe already knew where she
was. I was certain in my own mind that he had
smuggled her away from the house in which he lodged
that very night; that explained his presence in Murray
Olivant's rooms at the time I reached them with the
boy.</p>

<p>"You'll come here to-morrow, Tinman," said
Olivant, with a yawn, "and I'll give you money to
get the tickets, and full instructions. Then I'll tell
you where to engage a lodging for me, and under what
name. I mean to play the game thoroughly, I assure
you; not a living soul shall suspect who I am; no
one shall know till long afterwards that I have not
sailed for another country. It's a beautiful scheme;
we'll work it out to-morrow."</p>

<p>It was getting well into the small hours when I
came down the stairs at last, with Jervis Fanshawe
at my heels. I could not trust myself then to speak
to him; I held him in such loathing that I was afraid
of what I might do. He spoke to me once as I walked
away, but I paid no attention to him. I walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on and on doggedly, wondering bitterly what I should
do, and realizing more every moment how helpless I
was; seeing only that I was beating feeble hands
against a wall that I could not break down.</p>

<p>Suddenly he plucked me by the sleeve in a quiet
street through which we were passing; I turned suddenly,
and faced him. As he shrank away from me,
my rage overmastered me, and I caught him by the
throat and forced him to his knees.</p>

<p>"Where are you driving me?" I demanded hoarsely.
"Is not once enough, in a lifetime such as yours, to
strive to ruin a woman; is there no mercy in your
black heart at all?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he faltered.</p>

<p>"I understand only too well," I retorted savagely.
"Was it for this you met me when I came from prison;
was it for this that you have drawn me on and on,
until I am as desperately involved in this business
as yourself? What of your lying promises&mdash;your
pleadings that I would trust you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;indeed I only mean well&mdash;indeed I want to
help her!" he exclaimed, staggering to his feet, and
trying to pull my hands away from his collar. "I
can't tell you; I can't explain."</p>

<p>"The dead woman you have seen&mdash;whose eyes have
looked into yours&mdash;did she teach you nothing?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>He suddenly covered his face with his hands, and
shuddered. "She taught me something I shall not
forget," he whispered. "Only I must go on and
on; I dare not look back. I have set my hand to
something, and I will not stop now!" He raised
his haggard face to the sky, and if I had not had that
desperate hatred of him in my heart, I must have been
moved by the strange look upon it.</p>

<p>"No, you will not turn back, until you have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
this child to ruin and disgrace," I said. "But it may
be given to me to spoil your game yet; this new move
on the part of Olivant may lead to something he has
not reckoned upon&mdash;or you either."</p>

<p>"Yes, it may," he said; and he seemed to shudder
again.</p>

<p>A clock near at hand in a church tower struck three
over the sleeping city. I told Fanshawe I would not
go back with him then; I would walk the streets
until daylight. He tried to dissuade me from that,
but seeing that I had made up my mind he presently
turned away, and set off towards his lodging. I
tramped the streets until dawn&mdash;staring now and
then into the faces of poor wanderers that flitted
past me, in the vain hope of seeing the girl; but there
was no face like hers.</p>

<p>I got some breakfast at a coffee stall, and felt refreshed
and less hopeless. As I turned to go away,
I heard a voice beside me giving an order for some
coffee; I turned quickly, and saw that it was young
Arnold Millard. He looked forlorn and tired and
haggard; I was doubtful at first whether to speak
to him. I decided, however, that I might do some
good, if I persuaded him that Murray Olivant was
about to leave the country; it might at least drive
out of his mind the murderous thought that obsessed
it then. I ventured to touch his sleeve; he looked
round quickly, and recognized me.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wanted to say something about last night, sir,"
I replied in a whisper. "Surely it was better I should
prevent you from doing what was in your mind."</p>

<p>He took the cup of coffee from the man, and began
to drink it, without replying to me. I went on speaking
after a moment or two in an eager whisper.</p>

<p>"He lied to you, the young lady was not there at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
all," I said. "More than that, he's failed to get hold
of her, and he's giving up the game. He goes abroad
to-morrow. And I don't know where the young
lady is."</p>

<p>He looked at me over the cup he held, and spoke
sternly. "It's a lie&mdash;and you know it," he said
slowly. "Look me in my eyes now&mdash;fair and square&mdash;and
tell me that he's going away."</p>

<p>I suppose I was never a good hand at that business
of deceit; I tried now to raise my eyes to his; tried
to get some words out that should bravely defend the
statement I had made. But the words would not
come, and my eyes fell. I turned away hurriedly,
and I heard his derisive laughter echoing after me as
I went. I knew that I had only made matters worse.</p>

<p>I had gone but a few yards when he overtook me;
seized me roughly by the shoulder, and swung me
round, so that I faced him. "You are his servant and
his slave," he said contemptuously, "and so I suppose
you must lie for the sake of your bread and butter.
But tell him that his lies won't serve him; tell him that
my mind is as firmly made up about him as it ever will
be about anything. I know he's hiding from me&mdash;but
that shan't serve him. Tell him from me that
I mean to kill him, just as I said I would. It's his
body for her soul: a fair exchange!"</p>

<p>I would have protested further, but he waved me
aside impatiently, and strode off into the darkness.
I wondered then if there was any man in London that
morning quite so miserable as I was: any man who
had failed in everything he had undertaken as I had
failed. I had started out so well, with such high
hopes and such high ideals&mdash;and, lo! they had all
come to nothing, and it was written that I was to fail
again.</p>

<p>I carried that thought with me through all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
long day. It was with me when presently I went to
Murray Olivant's flat, and stood with apparent humility
before him, while he looked through his letters and
toyed with his breakfast; it was with me when he
put the money into my hands that was to pay, in part,
for his trick&mdash;that money with which I was to purchase
the steamer tickets. He had decided to go by
a comparatively small vessel to the Mediterranean;
or, at all events, to let it be thought that he was going
by that vessel. I remember that it was called the
<i>Eaglet</i>; and he kept up that mad trick so that he
was even careful as to the choosing of his cabin. I
was supposed to accompany him, and a berth was
engaged for me.</p>

<p>I went back to him later in the day, carrying the
tickets with me. I found the place in disorder, and
the manservant covering everything up, and locking
drawers and cupboards; Olivant himself was destroying
a great mass of letters. So thorough was the business
that I observed with some surprise some new
clothing, of a cheaper and commoner pattern than
that usually worn by him; it was only after the manservant
had left the room that he told me what this
clothing was intended for.</p>

<p>"I do everything thoroughly, Tinman," he said,
with a chuckle. "Everything here is packed up and
left; Murray Olivant walks out of the place, and disappears
from that moment. The world believes he
goes on board the <i>Eaglet</i>, to start for a pleasure cruise.
As a matter of fact he goes in those clothes"&mdash;he
pointed to the new garments I had before noticed&mdash;"and
he turns up in another place, and under another
name. You will know that other place, because you
will be there with me; and Jervis Fanshawe will know
it also; but that's all. I shall not have a scrap of
paper about me, nor a mark on my clothes by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
any one can point to me and say, 'That's Murray
Olivant!' I'm going to begin a new life with that sweet
child Barbara (she's bound to be found; she'll be glad
enough to come back to me)&mdash;and I shall keep that
life up for just as long as I wish. I'm taking money
enough to last me, in a modest way, until I resurrect
Murray Olivant, and bring him back again."</p>

<p>I was busied all that day on various errands for
him; it was late in the evening when he suddenly
put a newspaper before me, and pointed to an advertisement.
"That's the place for me," he said; "top
rooms, and quiet and secluded. Do you know Lincoln's
Inn Fields?"</p>

<p>I stared at the paper; it shook and rustled in my
fingers. "I wouldn't go there," I said, while a great
trembling seized upon me. "I wouldn't go there if I
were you."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with the man?" He
snatched the paper from me, and laughed. "Do you
think the place will be too dreary, or too quiet? Or
do you think I might see ghosts there?"</p>

<p>"I think you might see ghosts there," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not afraid of that," he retorted. "Go
at once and see the people; if the rooms are all right,
take them. Here's money; pay a quarter in advance.
You need not give any names, or anything of that sort;
it's a small place, and the money ought to be sufficient."</p>

<p>It was at that moment that there came a knock at
the outer door; immediately afterwards Jervis Fanshawe
was announced. Murray Olivant, who seemed
elated at the prospect of his new adventure, pointed to
the advertisement, and showed it to Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"Tinman here doesn't seem to like the idea of
Lincoln's Inn Fields," said Olivant with a laugh.
"What's your opinion, Fanshawe?"</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe stared at the newspaper for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
or two; then he raised his eyes to mine. It
seemed in that moment, as he looked at me, that there
was a frightened look in his face; I wondered if he read
my own thoughts. "Yes," he said, turning to Olivant,
and handing back the newspaper, "I should think
Lincoln's Inn Fields is the very spot."</p>

<p>I secured the rooms within an hour. It was strange
to me to walk again in that place, over whose pavements
my uneasy feet had trod twenty years before,
that time I waited for Gavin Hockley. I was glad to
find that the rooms were not in that building; but
they were too close at hand to be pleasant. I walked
away, with the old thoughts beginning to surge up
again in my brain; and once again I was desperately
afraid. I knew that some grim Fate was driving me on;
I could only set my weak shoulders against the storm
that pressed me forward; but I was powerless to stay
the force of it.</p>

<p>I came away from the flat, leaving Jervis Fanshawe
and the manservant still there. I understood that the
manservant was to be sent away that night, and the
flat locked up. I walked to the lodging that the elder
Barbara had taken; I felt that I owed it to her to tell
her at least that her child was gone, but was safe from
Murray Olivant. The decent woman who opened the
door to me told me that "Mrs. Avaline" was at home;
it had only occurred to me at the last moment to ask
for her in that name she had given herself.</p>

<p>Barbara met me at the door of the room; she held
out her hands to me, and seemed, I thought, strangely
excited. Nor would she for a moment let me into the
room; she stood there looking at me, and I felt her
hands tremble in mine.</p>

<p>"Guess&mdash;guess what has happened!" she whispered;
and at the look in her eyes I suddenly felt myself
trembling too. I thrust her aside, and went quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
into the little shabby room. A lamp was burning on
the table, and some needlework lay beside it. And on
a couch under the window lay that younger Barbara&mdash;peacefully
sleeping.</p>

<p>I stood there, looking down at her like a man in a
dream; I could not understand what had happened.
It was only when the mother began to speak to me in
her quiet voice that I understood how she had found
the child.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you&mdash;to be near you; I went
to that address you had told me, where you were living
with Fanshawe," she said softly. "I waited about,
afraid to go in; and while I waited there I saw you
come out with the man I suppose must have been
Murray Olivant&mdash;the man I had seen down at Hammerstone
Market. I could not speak to you then; I
waited in the hope that you would return. And while
I waited I saw this dear girl come stealing out of the
place like a frightened ghost; I knew, of course, who
she was, because I had seen her down at the old house,
and because she is so like what I was so long ago.
She did not know me, of course; she never will know
me; but when I spoke to her she seemed to turn in her
distress and fear to me instinctively. She came here
with me willingly; she will be safe here for the present."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" I whispered, as I looked down at the
sleeping girl. "This is all as it should be; now we
can decide what is best to be done."</p>

<p>"I mean to take her back to her father," she said
quietly. Then, as I started and looked at her, she
shook her head quietly, and smiled. "Don't be afraid,
Charlie; I'm not going back to him myself. I could
not do that now. But the girl is different; the girl
must go back to the home that is hers&mdash;and to her
father."</p>

<p>"There to be found by Murray Olivant whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
he likes," I reminded her. "You have forgotten that.
You&mdash;an unknown woman; I&mdash;a felon and an outcast;
what can we do to protect her against him?" I stood
there looking down at the sleeping girl; my heart
was beating fast. "But I think I know the way,"
I said slowly.</p>

<p>"You know the way?" She was looking at me
keenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the way I took before," I whispered, without
looking at her. "God is good; he has given my
enemy into my hands at last!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER X<br />

<a name="TOO_LATE" id="TOO_LATE">TOO LATE!</a></h3>


<p>For now it all seemed straight and plain before
me; now I saw clearly the pointing finger of
Fate, and trembled no more at the task I had to face.
Who was I, that I should ever have hung back at all,
or should ever have dreaded the road on which my feet
had been firmly set from the first. I looked down at the
sleeping girl, and my heart was filled with a great
gratitude that God had snatched me from death and
from prison, and had reserved me for this. I thanked
Him humbly that there was no other man in all the
wide world so trained and fitted for the task as I was.</p>

<p>I saw it all clearly enough at last. The time was
coming when this poor tangled love story would be set
right; when the boy would come naturally and by
instinct to the girl, and would take her in his arms, with
a very perfect understanding of her purity and her innocence;
so much had been ordained from the first.
If they gave a thought to me, it would only be as the
poor unknown grey-headed man that had been called
Tinman, and had flitted into their lives for a brief
hour, and flitted out again, and so been done with.
Even the woman who stood beside me&mdash;that elder
Barbara&mdash;was only mercifully permitted to look on
at the completion of the love story she and I might
have lived ourselves. After all, God had been very good
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't understand," Barbara was saying to me, as
we stood beside the sleeping girl. "What way will
you take?&mdash;what will you do?"</p>

<p>"You will know presently," I whispered, lest I
should wake the sleeper. "In any case, I want you to
promise one thing: I want you to take the girl back to
her father, and to leave her safely in his hands. Promise
me&mdash;swear to me that nothing shall turn you from
that purpose; nothing that you hear&mdash;nothing that
you suspect. All that I hope to do, and all that I shall
strive to do, will be brought to naught if you fail me in
that."</p>

<p>"I promise, my dear," she said solemnly. "But
Olivant?"</p>

<p>"Will trouble her no more," I replied. "I wonder
if you remember what I said to you once&mdash;twenty
long years ago?"</p>

<p>"I hope I remember," she whispered. "Say the
words again."</p>

<p>"I lay under sentence of death; I was to die the
next morning. You came to me; you had travelled
hard and fast to reach me before they killed me. Do
you remember?"</p>

<p>She bowed her head, and whispered that she did. I
went on&mdash;repeating the words I had used so long
before; they had been in my mind many many times
since, and I had not forgotten them.</p>

<p>"This is what I said to you. 'In the years that are
coming it may happen, in God's own good time, that
some child you love may stand in need of a friend who
will strike as I struck&mdash;fight as I fought&mdash;for her honour.
It may happen, long after I am dead and forgotten
by all but you, that some such an one may spring
up, to do again more perfectly what I did&mdash;springing
from the dead ashes of my past to work out the pitiful
story I began.' Do you remember?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perfectly," she whispered; and now she looked
at me with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"I never thought then," I went on, "that it would
fall to me to do again what I did then; I was as one
dead when I spoke those words. But all things have
fitted in so wonderfully and so strangely; there is no
drawing back for me, and there is no one else who can
strike the blow&mdash;no one with a greater right."</p>

<p>She drew me away out of the room, and closed the
door; we stood together on the landing outside, looking
into each other's eyes&mdash;I very calm and resolute,
and she trembling and afraid.</p>

<p>"You must not think of it," she whispered; "you
must never think of it. There must be some other
way&mdash;some better way. Not again, Charlie&mdash;for the
love of God!&mdash;not again!"</p>

<p>"There is no other way," I replied. "It is her soul
against his body; when you think of that, there is no
question. Besides, what does it matter? In the
sight of men my hands are stained with blood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>(She seized my hands suddenly, and put her lips to
them!)</p>

<p>"&mdash;And at the worst it may happen that I pay the
penalty I earned before. Besides," I added solemnly,
"I do not do this of myself. Step by step&mdash;day by
day&mdash;I have seen what was coming; I dare not draw
back now, whatever happens. If it is a crime, then the
man himself has drawn it down upon his own head.
Think of what he has done: to get hold of this girl he
has banished himself out of the world; has played a
trick, to persuade people that he is going on a long
voyage, while in reality he is in hiding&mdash;waiting like a
spider in his web&mdash;crouching ready to spring. Think of
that, Barbara; if I kill him to-night, I kill a man who
has no name, who is unknown; Murray Olivant will
be in another place altogether. For his own purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
he has covered up my footsteps&mdash;the footsteps of the
man setting out to kill him. There is a fate in this; I
dare not draw back."</p>

<p>She clung to me, and begged that I would think of her
and of the girl; implored me to remember that whereas
the crime for which I had been shut away before was
one of personal vengeance, with the hot blood of youth
for excuse, this was a deliberate thing, done for others
with whom I was not personally concerned. Upon that
point, however, I threw a new light.</p>

<p>"The girl sleeping there is but the image of the Barbara
I loved; the boy who would strike this blow, if I
did not, represents what I was&mdash;must represent in the
future what I might have been under happier circumstances.
I strike now for the love I bore you, Barbara,
and bear you still; and because I know that if I do not
this boy must step in, and commit the crime for which
I suffered through twenty long years. There is no
hope that he will turn back, any more than there is
any hope that Murray Olivant will give up his purpose."</p>

<p>She wept and implored me; to comfort her a little I
presently promised that if I saw any other way I would
take it; but in my own heart I knew there was no other
way.</p>

<p>"Remember&mdash;my dear&mdash;my dear," she pleaded,
"that we have both had to suffer so much&mdash;to lose so
much&mdash;to give up so much. Remember, too, what my
position is now; that it is my fate to stand as a mere
kindly stranger beside my child, and never to let her
know who I really am. I must live out my life alone,
as I have lived it these many years; I cannot go back
now; the old Barbara Savell lies in the depths of the
sea. That is my punishment, Charlie; don't make it
harder to bear than it is."</p>

<p>I went out into the streets, and made my way to the
rooms occupied by Fanshawe. Not that I wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
see the man: I hated him too cordially for that; but
that I felt I must be strong for the work that was before
me, and must get some proper rest. I was worn out
already with that long night spent in tramping about
the streets; I knew I must sleep, if sleep was possible;
I set all my mind upon that, because so much depended
on whether my nerves served me well when the time
came for what I had to do.</p>

<p>Fanshawe was out when I arrived, but he came back
within a few minutes&mdash;coming into the room in some
excitement, I thought, as though he had been hurried.
He tossed his hat on to the bed, and came across to
where I was seated, and clapped me on the shoulder
jocosely.</p>

<p>"Well, my Charlie!" he exclaimed, "what's the
news with you&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>I looked up at him sourly enough. "No news," I
replied.</p>

<p>"No sign of the girl yet? No whisper of where
she is?"</p>

<p>I faced round upon him angrily. "Leave her name
alone," I said. "If I knew anything I shouldn't tell
you, and I warn you that if you try to meddle in any
way in the matter, you'll have to reckon with me in a
fashion you little suspect. Mind&mdash;I mean it!"</p>

<p>I had half expected that he would fly into a passion,
as I had seen him do on other occasions; instead, he
looked at me almost wistfully out of his deep eyes for a
moment before he turned away.</p>

<p>"You won't understand, Charlie," he said. "I
only want to help the girl&mdash;I only want her to think
well of me."</p>

<p>I laughed at him openly; I thought he played the
game poorly enough; I felt that he had perhaps got a
notion that if he was soft with me, I might be led to tell
him anything I knew. I hardened my heart; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
had had too much of this man not to be able to judge
him for what he really was.</p>

<p>He brought out some liquor presently, and I, being
faint and weary, readily drank with him. Not a word
was said for a long time; until presently, leaning across
the table, and tapping upon it with his long bony
fingers, he whispered a word or two that startled me.</p>

<p>"Charlie&mdash;Charlie!" Then, as I glanced up at him,
and saw his hungry eyes fixed upon me, he went on in
tones little above a whisper, and with a curious mocking
grin on his face: "Charlie!&mdash;how does it feel to kill
a man?"</p>

<p>I turned round slowly; I saw in a moment that he
had read my secret. My fear was not that he might
do anything to me; my only dread was that he might
warn Murray Olivant, if indeed he had not already done
so.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"You're a man of evil passions, Charlie&mdash;of hot and
sudden passions," he said. "Twenty years ago you
killed Gavin Hockley&mdash;struck him down, as you might
have struck any noxious beast in your way. Your
blood was up, Charlie"&mdash;he had risen excitedly to his
feet, and was leaning across the table towards me, with
his hands gripping the edges, and his eyeballs almost
starting from their sockets&mdash;"you were like a man
rushing into battle, caring nothing for what you did.
That was fine&mdash;that was noble; but afterwards, Charlie&mdash;afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," I said feebly.</p>

<p>"When the thing was done; when you crept out into
the streets, knowing what you'd left behind you. Tell
me, Charlie&mdash;tell me; did it creep down the stairs in
your wake&mdash;bloody and horrible; did you hear its
feet pattering on the stones in quiet streets; did you
look over your shoulder, and see its glazing eyes staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
at you&mdash;its mouth with the drooping jaw striving to
scream 'Murder!' after you? Tell me, Charlie."</p>

<p>"I forget," I replied. "After all&mdash;what does it
matter now?"</p>

<p>"But suppose, Charlie&mdash;only suppose," he went on,
in that same hoarse whisper&mdash;"imagine for a moment
that you set out to do it again?"</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, and confronted him. "What
madman's talk is this?" I demanded, with a glance
at the door. "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Suppose, Charlie," he went on, paying no heed to
my excitement&mdash;"suppose that this time you set out&mdash;not
in the heat of passion&mdash;not because the man had
injured you&mdash;but to do it in cold blood! Suppose you
crept up his stair&mdash;and listened at his door&mdash;and stole
in upon him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I clapped my hand suddenly over his lips. "Silence!"
I cried&mdash;"you don't know what you're talking about.
I've forgotten all I did; it's twenty long years ago.
Don't remind me of it." For I thought in that way I
might divert his thoughts into another channel; I was
firmly persuaded that in some amazing fashion he had
guessed what I was about to do, and was endeavouring
to screw the truth of it out of me.</p>

<p>He had dropped back into his chair, and was looking
at me cunningly between half-closed lids. I had determined
by that time that he should not stop me; I
was certain of that, even while I realized that the time
must surely come when he would denounce me, and
cry out that I had done this thing. The thought of that
did not stay me in the least; I meant to go on. But
the natural desire to shield myself, if possible&mdash;the
sheer human instinct of self-preservation&mdash;told me that
I must if possible throw him off the scent. I began
to talk to him with what ease I might.</p>

<p>"Come, Fanshawe&mdash;it's not for you and me to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of murder," I said. "Why should I do again what I
have done once already? What reason would there be
in it?"</p>

<p>"No reason&mdash;no reason at all, Charlie," he said,
plucking at his lips with his long fingers, and watching
me. "I don't know what put the idea into my mind
to-night&mdash;I don't know what made me think of it.
Only I would give something to know just what a
man feels, when he creeps away, and leaves behind
him that dead thing that was but a moment before
alive and strong. It would be something to know what
one feels like then. And the weapon, Charlie&mdash;what
of the weapon?"</p>

<p>I remembered then that I had seen that day in a
marine-store dealer's, not a hundred yards from the
place where now we talked, the weapon I meant to serve
my purpose. It was a strong sailor's knife in a leather
sheath&mdash;a powerful thing, with a hilt well worn by
hands that had grasped it many times; I had stood
outside the shop, and had looked at my own hand, and
had felt how perfectly it would fit round the handle.
I stared at him now as he spoke, and wondered if by
any chance he had seen me looking in at that window,
and had read my thoughts.</p>

<p>"You know the weapon I used," I said, in a low
voice. "It was an old sword."</p>

<p>"I know, Charlie&mdash;I know," he said, nodding. "But
if you did it again&mdash;if you wanted to do it more quickly
and more cleanly&mdash;what then? A knife's a good
weapon; what about a knife, Charlie?"</p>

<p>I felt sick and faint; I got up, and went to the window,
and threw it open. It was a fine night&mdash;a night of
stars and of peace, even with London throbbing in the
streets down below me. I thought of the child who
had lain asleep&mdash;of the mother who watched over her;
I thought of the man who was plotting against that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
little Barbara, and my heart hardened. Though a
hundred Fanshawes stood in the way, I meant that this
thing should be done, and that the man should die. I
had bungled it somehow, so that Fanshawe knew; I
must pay the penalty of that afterwards. One thought
was in my mind, and one only: he should not stop
me.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the boy&mdash;young Arnold Millard?"
I asked, more for the sake of saying something than in
the hope of gaining information.</p>

<p>"I saw him to-day," replied Fanshawe slowly:
"still hanging about that place. I wonder what would
happen if by chance he found out where Olivant is
going?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we know what would happen," I replied.
"What's the use of talking about it?"</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for him to get away from that
subject; he came back to it again and again. I remember
that he crossed the room, and came and stood
near to me, looking down into the street, and speaking
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"If a man struck down another like that&mdash;for a fine
noble reason, Charlie&mdash;would that be wrong? I mean,
would it be so vile as it might be if a man did it for any
worse motive? If he did it&mdash;and escaped; for how
long would it haunt him afterwards? You remember,
Charlie; for how long did you think about it&mdash;and
remember it? Did the blood-stained thing come to
you in dreams&mdash;mock at you, and haunt you. One
would like to know that."</p>

<p>"Look here," I said roughly. "You've got some
strange idea in your head."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; not in my head, Charlie; I was only
supposing&mdash;putting a case," he broke in hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Well, don't suppose&mdash;and don't put cases," I
cried savagely. "All that has been done is done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
with; why should you rake it up? Am I likely to
do again what I did before?&mdash;to put my neck once
again in the noose?"</p>

<p>"No, Charlie," he faltered&mdash;"of course not."</p>

<p>"Very well, then&mdash;leave it alone," I urged. "I'm
worn out, and I need sleep; I mustn't be late to-morrow;
there are many things to be seen to."</p>

<p>He said he would sit up for a time; at his suggestion
I threw myself down on the bed, dressed as I
was, and fell asleep. The last vision I had of him
was as he sat at the table, with a flaring candle throwing
ghostly shadows of him on the wall and ceiling,
and with his plucking hands for ever at his lips. He
watched me, even as I watched him, out of half-closed
eyes; I wondered how much he knew, or how much
he guessed.</p>

<p>I woke long after daylight, to find him gone. There
was for a moment in my heart that little swift pang
of excitement that comes to any one of us, when, on
waking, we remember some urgent and difficult thing
that has to be done before we sleep again&mdash;a journey,
or an interview, or anything else shut in between sunrise
and sunset of one particular date; but no more
than that. I had no worldly affairs to set right&mdash;no
one I need consult; no peace to make with any one.
I had long ago told myself that this was right, and
that to this end I must surely come. In doing it I
was to save two people: the girl in the first place,
and the boy in the second. For I knew inevitably
that young Arnold Millard would carry out his threat,
and that, too, with less hesitation if he found his enemy
hidden away, as Murray Olivant was to be hidden
away that day.</p>

<p>I went again to the marine-store dealer's; saw with
satisfaction that the knife was still there. I had
money in my pocket&mdash;part of the amount that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
been handed to me on the previous day by Olivant;
I went into the shop, and asked that I might look at
the knife. A dingy old man behind the counter
adjusted his spectacles to look at me; perhaps he wondered
that a tall grey-haired man, with bowed shoulders
and with a respectable black suit on, should want
such a weapon as that. But he pulled it out of the
window, and spread it out before me; I muttered
something about wanting it for a present. I pulled
it out from its sheath, and felt the edge of it; there
was a deadly sharpness about it that made me shudder
involuntarily, as I remembered where that sharpness
was to be planted.</p>

<p>It was old and well-worn, but in good condition;
the sheath was suspended from a narrow black belt,
meant to buckle round the waist. I did not care to
put it on there; I got the man to wrap it up for me,
paid him for it, and came away. Presently, in a quiet
street, I tore away the paper wrapping, and buckled the
thing round my waist, setting the sheath in such a
way at my back that I could easily reach the hilt of the
knife. Then I buttoned my coat, and went on towards
Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

<p>When I got there I found that Olivant had not yet
arrived; it flashed across me in a moment that he did
not even know yet that I had secured the rooms, and
that he would be waiting until I could reach him, and
give him the keys of the place. Cursing myself for my
carelessness, and fearing that he might decide after
all, on some whim, not to take the rooms, I hurried
off to his flat. I climbed the stairs to reach it, and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>After some little delay he opened the door himself,
and peered out at me; flung the door wide, on seeing
who it was, and let me in. He was in his dressing
gown, and as he strode across the hall and into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sitting-room I remembered suddenly that the manservant
had been sent away the night before, and
that Olivant was alone there. A sudden feeling that
I might do it then swept over me, and my hand instinctively
went to the knife at my back.</p>

<p>I was sane enough to remember in a moment that
I had been seen coming and going from that place
over and over again; to remember also that young
Millard had waited outside there, and had forced his
way into those rooms, and had been ejected from
them. That momentary impulse on my part, if carried
out, might ruin everything; I must wait until Murray
Olivant had voluntarily hidden himself.</p>

<p>He was in a vile temper; in sending away his manservant
he had forgotten that he could get no breakfast
without the man's assistance. I hurriedly set to work
to prepare coffee; he fumed about the rooms, roundly
cursing me, and declaring over and over again that
he'd give up this fool's business, and remain comfortably
where he was.</p>

<p>"I've been in too much of a hurry," he declared.
"I might have known I should have to suffer every
sort of discomfort; I ought not to have been afraid
of what Millard would do. It's absurd."</p>

<p>"The rooms are taken, and they're very snug and
comfortable," I reminded him. "You'll have the
laugh of every one if you slip off there. The thing
has been so well planned."</p>

<p>"So it has," he replied, with a smile breaking over
his face. "By Jove!&mdash;you're right there, Tinman;
it's been devilishly well planned. As soon as I've
had my breakfast I'll slip out&mdash;(by the back way,
Tinman, for fear of accidents)&mdash;and later in the day
I'll make my way to Lincoln's Inn Fields. I'll wander
about for a bit&mdash;enjoying a new sort of freedom; dine
somewhere quietly, and go there this evening. Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
you got in a stock of what I shall need&mdash;wines and
spirits, and so forth?"</p>

<p>I assured him that he would find everything he
required; I left the keys with him, explaining carefully
which of them fitted the various doors. One
thing only I did not tell him: that I had a duplicate
key of the outer door, given to me by the agents from
whom I had taken the place. They had explained
to me that the rooms had been previously occupied
by two friends, so that the second key had been necessary.
I remember that when that second key came
into my hands I felt again that Fate had played her
cards well, and had given me all I asked, and more.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what time I shall be there,
Tinman," said Olivant, just before I left. "You
can hang about a bit if I'm not there, and wait till I
come. I'm expecting Jervis Fanshawe to come here
this morning; he may have some news for me. By
the way, don't blunder over this, Tinman."</p>

<p>"Blunder?" I stared at him stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes; don't be telling people that I'm still in
London; remember that I've sailed on the Eaglet, and
that I'm not coming back for months. Tell everybody
that. And if you see Fanshawe at his lodgings, send
him to me at once."</p>

<p>I decided, of course, that I would not do that in any
case. Already I began to fear that what I had said I
should do would not be done after all; Fanshawe had
guessed my secret, and was going that morning to see
Olivant; obviously the first thing he would do would
be to put Olivant upon his guard. I wondered how
Fanshawe had come to guess what I had believed to
be so securely locked in my own heart; I blamed
myself that I had not been more careful in guarding
the very expression of my face. However, I knew
that I must risk all now upon the one throw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>The events of that day are stamped clearly enough
upon my recollection; almost I seem to see myself
walking again through the streets, waiting for the
hour when I could make for Lincoln's Inn Fields.
Just as on that other occasion, when I had set about a
similar business, so now I found myself going back
to scenes I knew, and looking again at various places,
as it were for the last time. For I had counted my
chances; and I knew that even while every door
seemed closed that could by any possibility let suspicion
in, one might be standing open, and I unable
to see it. If once Murray Olivant were recognized,
that confidential servant who had been seen about
with him must be looked for; must be discovered to
be a certain Charles Avaline&mdash;who had killed a man
before, and barely escaped the gallows for his crime.
I counted the chances, and the scale weighed heavily
against me.</p>

<p>I drifted back in the course of that long day to the
rooms from which Murray Olivant must long since
have gone, and there caught a glimpse of a lurking
figure that I knew must be Arnold Millard. He did
not see me; he was doggedly pacing up and down,
watching that empty cage, and waiting for his man,
who would not come out of that place again.</p>

<p>Then I went to the lodging where Barbara and the
girl had been the night before; I wondered if Barbara
had yet kept her promise to take the girl away, back
to her father. Surely in time, I thought, young Millard
must drift back there, and meet the girl; and so round
off the love story in which I was so strongly interested.</p>

<p>I found I could not eat; twice I had gone into
various places, and ordered a meal, and left the food
untouched. And yet I did not seem to need food;
all sensation seemed dead within me, or at all events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
only sharpened to the point of what I had to do.
And so at last I came in the dusk into Lincoln's Inn
Fields; found the house, and climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>I listened at the door for a moment or two; then
softly pushed the key into the lock, and passed into
the rooms. They were in darkness, and for a moment
or two I stood listening, wondering if the man had yet
arrived. Then I called his name, and heard it echoing
through the ghostly silent place, and coming back
at me as though in mockery&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Olivant! Mr. Olivant!"</p>

<p>I came out again, and lingered about near the house.
There were few people about at that time; only once
a pair of lovers passed me, as another pair of lovers,
twenty years before, had walked in front of me on such
a night in that place. I found myself wondering idly
what had become of that first pair; whether they had
been parted, or whether they had married, or what had
become of them. Even while I thought that, I saw
Murray Olivant striding along the pavement in the
distance, with his cigar stuck in one corner of his
mouth, and a thin trail of smoke floating behind
him.</p>

<p>I got out of the way hurriedly, and let him go into
the house without seeing me. I stood there, trying to
think how he would climb the stairs&mdash;how long it would
take him to reach this landing, and now that; so
many more moments for his fumbling with a lock he
did not understand; and now he was in the place,
waiting for me!</p>

<p>And then all at once I felt that I could not do it. I
turned away, sick at heart; I began to invent excuses
why I should not do it. I had soiled my hands once
with blood in my own cause; I would not do it again
for another. I was afraid; I weakly told myself that
another way would be found, and that Murray Olivant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
triumph would be cut short. But not by
me.</p>

<p>I went away into the busier streets, and I walked
about for more than an hour. It was quite dark when
I got back at last to the place, and even then I think
I had made up my mind that I could not do it. I
found myself praying, as I went up the stairs, that he
might insult me&mdash;might even attack or strike me&mdash;so
that I might be forced to do the thing, and to do it not
in cold blood. If only it might be a matter of fighting&mdash;some
desperate business that should nerve my arm
for the one necessary moment&mdash;then I would not mind.</p>

<p>I climbed the stairs, and reached the door of the
rooms. As I fumbled for my key, I suddenly discovered
that the door was open a couple of inches; I
put my hands against it, and went quietly in. The
place was in darkness; but I remember that I had
that curious feeling that one has, even in the darkness,
that there was some one there near me. I called
out the man's name again, as I had done before&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Olivant! Mr. Olivant!"</p>

<p>Only the echoes floated back to me; I could not
understand what the silence meant. At last with
trembling fingers I got out a match-box, and struck
a light, and looked about me.</p>

<p>I saw that the table had been set out with a decanter
and a glass; there was a half-smoked cigar lying there,
and it had burnt a hole in the faded table-cloth. A
candlestick had been overturned, and the candle had
rolled away a few inches from it. I set them upright,
and put the match to the candle. In doing that I came
to the edge of the table, and mechanically looked
over; I started back with a cry.</p>

<p>Murray Olivant was there in his own rooms, after all.
But he lay stiff and stark, with his face upturned to
the ceiling, and his dead eyes staring up at me. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
was stone dead; his hand still gripped the knife that
had been plunged straight into his breast, as though
in his death agony he would have torn it out.</p>

<p>I was too late; some one had been there before me.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />

<a name="I_TELL_THE_TRUTH" id="I_TELL_THE_TRUTH">I TELL THE TRUTH</a></h3>


<p>My first thought, after that ghastly discovery,
was to run to the outer door and close
it. After that, the mere coming back into the room
was an effort; I was afraid of that grim thing lying
there, stark and still, with the knife sticking in its
breast&mdash;afraid most of all of what it suggested.</p>

<p>For I saw now that a hatred greater and deeper than
mine had pursued this man, and had struck him down
before my slower vengeance could reach him. As I
stood in the room, in that silence greater than any
silence I had known before, I realized that all that I
had feared, and all that I had fought against had
happened, after all: the boy had been here before
me, and had struck down his enemy. There was
no doubt about that at all: all the precautions Murray
Olivant had taken had availed him nothing. Surely
and resolutely young Arnold Millard had tracked him
down, and had killed him, as he had sworn to do.</p>

<p>I stood there by the table for what seemed a long
time, wondering what I should do. For now the
instinct to cover up this crime was stronger in me than
it would have been had the man been struck down
by my own hands. In a pitiful fashion I knew the
business, and had paid the penalty of it before; I
should have gone into it, and indeed had meant to go
into it, with my eyes open, knowing well the desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
risk I ran. But with the boy it was different; he was
only poor Charlie Avaline again, of twenty years before,
who had flung himself upon this man in sheer bitter
rage, and without thought of what he must pay for
the blow.</p>

<p>I looked about the room. A chair had been overturned,
and I guessed that Murray Olivant had made
something of a struggle with his murderer, but had
had no chance really to defend himself. The candle
I had seen knocked over seemed to suggest that the
man who had struck the blow had knocked over the
light, in sheer horror of that dying face staring up at
him: that seemed natural enough. There was nothing
else disturbed; a glass upon the table held a little
whisky and soda still, and on the rim of it were to be
seen the impression of the lips of the drinker. The
cigar that had burnt its way into the table-cloth had
long since gone out. The whole place was unnaturally
still.</p>

<p>I stood there looking down at the dead man; for if
the truth be told I dared not put the table between us;
there was an uncanny feeling in me that he might stir,
and get up, and come towards me&mdash;dead, and yet
moving&mdash;with that knife sticking out of him. I kept
near him, that I might be sure where he was, and above
all that he was still. And I began to calculate the
chances again&mdash;not for myself this time, but for the
boy.</p>

<p>For in this, of course, I had the advantage of a
dreadful experience. I seemed to know that Arnold
Millard would strike down his man without fear of any
consequences&mdash;without thought of any penalty he
might have to pay. That done, he would walk out of
the place, and would take his way through the streets,
not caring greatly what happened to him. I had
done that, ever so many years before; and therein I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
had been mistaken. I had walked straight into the
arms of those who waited for me; I had not cared.
But this boy <i>must</i> care; in a sense, he must be saved
from himself. There was no one now that could guide
him out of the labyrinth into which he had gone but
myself; I only knew where the hammers were going,
and where the scaffold was being built, with its black
arm pointing to the grave; I only could meet him on
that road, and from bitter experience turn him aside,
and show him another secret road to travel&mdash;a road
by which he might escape. I blessed God for my
knowledge then.</p>

<p>In the dread silence of the room I found myself
addressing the dead man; leaning over the table to
look down at him fearfully, as though he could hear me.</p>

<p>"It may be that <i>you</i> will save him, after all," I
whispered. "You have hidden yourself here&mdash;you
are an unknown man; they cannot find out anything
about you. If he is silent, it may happen that no
one will ever suspect. But will he be silent?&mdash;that
is the point. Or will he feel, in a cooler moment, that
this deed cuts him off for ever from those for whose
sake it was done. What will he do?"</p>

<p>Once again I found myself counting and calculating
the chances&mdash;not for myself, but for another this time.
In some strange fashion the boy must have tracked
Murray Olivant to this place; must have struck him
down; and must now be wandering, with that brand
of Cain upon him, fighting the desperate battle with
himself that a man must fight who has in one moment
put himself outside the sphere of ordinary things; and
so is hiding and dodging in a crowded world to escape.</p>

<p>I remembered that certain steamer tickets had been
bought, in order to carry out that deception which
had after all been useless; I knew that those tickets
must be in the possession of the dead man. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
cowardice of one who puts off what he knows to be
inevitable until the last moment, I searched everywhere
for them about the room&mdash;looking on the mantelshelf,
and in a small new portmanteau in the inner
room&mdash;everywhere but where I knew instinctively
they must be. Then at last, when there was nothing
else to be done, I turned to the man himself, and knelt
beside him.</p>

<p>Even as I did so I raised my head, and listened.
The night was very still and windless; there was not a
sound anywhere about the house. But I had distinctly
heard the scrape of a footstep on the landing outside&mdash;that,
and the movement of some one against the
door. I got up very slowly and stealthily from my
knees, and suddenly blew out the candle; then I felt
my way to the door of the room, and stood listening
again.</p>

<p>There was a small lobby outside this room, and at
the further side of it the door leading to the staircase.
While I stood there, I distinctly heard some one pressing
against the door: heard the heavy breathing of
some one who was evidently striving to peer through
the keyhole. I stood perfectly still in the darkness,
and listened; heard cautious footsteps moving away
from the door, and then with greater confidence going
more loudly down the stairs. And I knew instinctively
that the murderer had been there, and had gone away
again.</p>

<p>There had been a sudden thought in my mind for
a moment that I would follow him; would overtake
him, and so, coming face to face with him, make him
understand that I knew the truth. With that understanding
there might have come the knowledge that
I was his friend, who had suffered just as he must be
suffering now, and who was ready and willing to help
him. But that thought was gone as quickly as it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
come; I felt that I should only be met with furious
denials; I knew that I must keep my knowledge to
myself for the present.</p>

<p>It was difficult work going back into that room,
and standing there fumbling to get a light. But I
accomplished it at last, and once more went upon my
knees beside the dead man, and began to fumble dreadfully
in his pockets for the tickets. They were easily
found, because the man seemed to have nothing else
of any value in his pockets at all; he had carried out
what he had promised, in that he had destroyed all
marks of identification. So with the tickets in my
hand I sat down on a chair (still keeping him well in
view, lest he should dreadfully come to life again),
and thought about what I had to do.</p>

<p>I fitted the thing together like a puzzle. Murray
Olivant on the sea, on board the Eaglet; Murray
Olivant so far accounted for, for some considerable time
at least. On the other hand, Murray Olivant here
as an unknown man&mdash;dead by an unknown hand.
The first thing to be done obviously was to get rid
of the tickets. For the present I thrust them into my
own pocket, meaning to destroy them at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Then I went carefully through the rooms, to be
certain that there was nothing by which Olivant could
be identified. I found, as I had expected, that there
was no scrap of clothing anywhere that was marked;
everything was of that newer cheaper kind that he
had purchased for the better carrying out of his trick.
I had left the most dreadful task to the last; and that
was to examine the knife.</p>

<p>I had not the courage to pull it out; I took the
candle from the table, and bent down to examine it.
It was a knife not unlike that which I carried; it had
been well worn, but was a powerful weapon, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
sort carried by sailors. I looked at it carefully, and
was relieved to find that there were no distinguishing
marks upon the handle: it was a common thing, such
as the boy might have bought for a few shillings, just
as I had bought the one that was slung about my
waist.</p>

<p>I had done all that it was possible for me to do, and
I now prepared for departure. I extinguished the
candle, and got to the door; stood listening for a
moment, in the fear that that visitor of a little time
before might have returned, and might be waiting.
But there was no sound, and after a moment or two
I opened the door, and peered out. No one there,
and the house wrapped in silence.</p>

<p>Emboldened by that, I pulled the door wide, and
stepped out, and closed it behind me. I turned to
put my hand against it, to be certain that it was
fastened, and recoiled with a cry. For there was a
man standing there, flat against the wall at one side
of the door, looking at me. It was Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what's the matter?" I asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>He grinned at me; his voice when he spoke was
the mere thread of a whisper. "Nothing&mdash;nothing
at all," he said. "How's our friend?" He jerked
his head towards the closed door as he spoke.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's all right," I faltered, stooping to fumble
with the lock for a moment, the better to hide my
face. "Tired&mdash;gone to sleep."</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe moved away from me to the head
of the stairs; peered over there down into the darkness
below for a moment or two in silence. Then he
turned swiftly, and laid his hand on my arm, and
without looking at me began to pull me towards the
stairs. "Come away," he whispered&mdash;"come away!"</p>

<p>I was halfway down the stairs before I realized
what he meant, or what he thought. And then in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
moment it flashed upon me that he knew in his own
mind that Murray Olivant was dead, and believed
that I had killed him. I had seen that thought growing
in his mind when he had spoken to me about what
my feelings must have been when I had killed Gavin
Hockley; I knew now that the man was absolutely
certain as to what had happened, and that he had
fastened the crime upon me. For a moment I stopped
on the stairs, and looked at him with a momentary
feeling of dismay in my heart&mdash;momentary only, because
the next instant I realized that this was, after
all, the best thing that could happen. He might say
or do anything, so far as I was concerned; it would
be like flogging a dead man; my only dread had been
that he might fasten the crime upon the right pair of
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why do you stare at me like that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Was I staring?" he asked, with that grin again
stealing over his features. "I was only thinking,"
he added; and then, dropping his voice to a whisper,
he asked, as he glanced up the stairs towards the door
we had left: "Tell me&mdash;does he sleep soundly?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I said hoarsely; and turned and
went down the stairs, with Fanshawe following. He
spoke no further words; as I strode on through the
streets he came after me at a sort of trot&mdash;ever keeping
a little behind me and at my elbow.</p>

<p>Knowing what I knew, and guessing that he had
put that fearful interpretation upon my words, I found
him presently to be a very ghost of a man, coming
along always with that soft footfall just behind me.
Once or twice I stopped on some pretext; but he
always stopped too, and would not be shaken off. And
so at last we came to that lodging down by the river,
and were admitted by the girl Moggs. While we stood
for a moment in the little dingy passage of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the girl jerked her head towards the stairs, and said,
without looking at us&mdash;</p>

<p>"'E's up there."</p>

<p>Then she disappeared into her own quarters. I
could not understand what she meant; I was puzzling
my brains to know who could possibly have called
upon us, or what fresh disaster this might mean, when
I became aware of a sudden change that had come
over my companion. He was leaning against the
wall, mouthing and shivering, and plucking at his
lips, and staring towards the staircase. I looked back
at him, and called&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you? What are you afraid
of?"</p>

<p>He came towards me, edging along the wall of the
passage until he could lay his hand upon mine and
grip me. "Didn't you hear what she said?" he
whispered. "He's up there&mdash;waiting for us! Don't
you understand, you fool, that he'd come quicker
than we could; didn't you think of that?"</p>

<p>The sheer terror in the man's face unnerved me;
I found myself gripping him, as if I, too, had suddenly
grown afraid.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" I whispered.
"It's some chance caller. Don't be a fool!"</p>

<p>I was shaken to my very soul; but I went on up
the stairs, looking back, to find him following more
slowly. I saw that he was ready, at a chance word
or gesture, to go tumbling down the stairs again, and
screaming out into the night. I hesitated for a
moment at the door of the room, and opened it, and
went in. Standing before the cheerless hearth was
the man Dawkins.</p>

<p>I glanced over my shoulder, to see a ghastly face
coming round the door&mdash;a face that changed in a
moment from terror to relief&mdash;from relief to a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
childish rage. Jervis Fanshawe came into the room
a little blusteringly, and scowled at the visitor.</p>

<p>"What do you want here at this time of night?"
he demanded. "Startling people&mdash;and making them
think&mdash;&mdash; What do you want?"</p>

<p>Dawkins stared at this hitherto humble man in
some amazement. "Don't be insolent," he said at
last. "I want to find Murray Olivant."</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?" snapped Jervis
Fanshawe, before I could say a word. "And why
do you seek him here?"</p>

<p>"Because I can't find him at his rooms," retorted
Dawkins. "The place is shut up, and apparently
deserted; even his servant has gone. What's the
mystery?"</p>

<p>"There is no mystery," I said slowly. "Mr.
Murray Olivant has gone on a voyage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; on a voyage," corroborated Fanshawe
eagerly. "That's true enough."</p>

<p>"He sails to-morrow on the <i>Eaglet</i>, bound for the
Mediterranean," I went on. "I am to join him&mdash;to
sail with him."</p>

<p>"Strange that I've heard nothing about it," muttered
Dawkins, looking from one to the other of us.
"I think I can guess what has happened, however;
our friend has got hold of the girl, and is slipping
away quietly with her&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say," said Fanshawe. "In any case,
I wouldn't trouble about it, if I were you; it's not
worth while."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Dawkins, with a
grin. "Murray Olivant mustn't imagine for a moment
that he is going to use me as he likes, and then fling
me aside, without so much as a 'Thank you.' I don't
believe in this sailing business; I don't believe he's
going at all. There's some trick in this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's no trick," exclaimed Fanshawe eagerly.
"He sails to-morrow, and Tinman here goes with him."</p>

<p>I confess I was a little surprised at this eager advocacy
of my cause on the part of Fanshawe; I could
not understand it. I firmly believed that he thought
I had killed the man Olivant; but I should have
imagined he was the last person to endeavour to shield
me. Yet here he was carrying on that trick that had
been practised on every one, and assisting me to hide
Murray Olivant away. I could not understand it.</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing," persisted Dawkins. "Does
he take the girl with him?"</p>

<p>I answered immediately: "No; he does not take
her. He does not even know where she is, and he has
decided to give up the whole business."</p>

<p>"I can't understand it, and I don't believe it,"
said Dawkins, moving towards the door. "You're
hiding something from me."</p>

<p>I slipped my hand into my pocket, and drew out
the envelope containing the steamer tickets. Without
a word I pulled out the tickets, and showed them to
him. "I am to meet my master early to-morrow
morning with these, and to take him on board. Does
that convince you?"</p>

<p>He looked at the tickets and at me; something in
my manner evidently impressed him. "Well," he
said, "it's no affair of mine&mdash;and he was always an
erratic sort of fellow. But why couldn't he have let
me know that he was going?"</p>

<p>"You forget," I reminded him, "that you have
been endeavouring to get a large sum of money out
of him."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," he replied, with a
laugh. "I don't like being made a fool of; I hope
the infernal vessel will blow up, or sink, or something,
with the pair of you on board."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," I responded quietly, as he went
out, slamming the door after him.</p>

<p>Jervis Fanshawe was seated on the bed, rubbing
his hands, and laughing softly to himself. "That was
well done, Charlie; that was excellently done," he
said, in a hoarse whisper. "You're a clever fellow,
Charlie; you've covered up the traces beautifully."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," I replied coldly. "There
are no traces to cover up, beyond those we know
already. Murray Olivant is in hiding&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;in hiding," he whispered, nodding his
head many times, and sucking in his lips, and rubbing
his long bony hands together. "In hiding's the word.
And he'll sleep soundly to-night&mdash;won't he, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"I imagine so," I replied, looking at him steadily.
"Why do you insist upon that point?"</p>

<p>"Do I insist upon it, Charlie?" he asked innocently.
"Not at all&mdash;not at all. Only I like to think
of him in those snug rooms of his in Lincoln's Inn
Fields&mdash;sleeping well&mdash;sleeping as long as he likes,
Charlie&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>There was that between us which seemed to make
it necessary that my eyes should seek his, and that
his should be fastened on mine. Even when I moved
round the room, I saw that his eyes followed me. And
I knew what was in his mind. I would not trust him;
I would never trust him again; for the sake of the
boy who had done this thing in a moment of madness,
I must let Fanshawe think what he would.</p>

<p>"We'd better sleep," I said, as I turned the key in
the door. "And, as for Murray Olivant&mdash;let him
sleep."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Charlie&mdash;we can leave him&mdash;to sleep
soundly," he said, nodding his head at me. "He's
safe enough."</p>

<p>He stretched himself on the bed, and seemed to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
asleep at once. I had curled myself up in a corner,
and was slowly nodding to slumber, when I thought
he moved; I asked sleepily if he wanted anything.
There was no reply, and the only sound in the room
was his steady breathing. I decided sleepily that
everything might well wait until the morrow; my head
dropped forward on my breast, and I slept heavily.</p>

<p>I had no recollection of anything during the night,
save that it seemed to me once that some one touched
me, and that I fretfully begged to be left alone. But
I awoke in the morning to find the bed unoccupied,
and only myself in the room. Fanshawe was gone.
I wondered about it a little, and yet was relieved to
be rid of him.</p>

<p>I had got clearly in my mind what I was to do. I
wanted to know that Barbara and the girl were safe
at Hammerstone Market; I wanted to be certain that
the girl was back again in her father's house. Always
when I got to that point I stopped, and my thoughts
refused to travel further. For while Murray Olivant
was safely out of the way, never to trouble the child's
peace again, there always came on top of that the
shuddering remembrance that the boy had killed him,
and that only afterwards, if he was the boy I knew him
to be, would there come upon him the knowledge that
with that knife thrust he had killed not only Murray
Olivant, but all hope of any love story with Barbara.
That was one of the problems I had to solve; to know
what the boy would do.</p>

<p>I was certain in my own mind that Barbara, at least,
would keep her promise to me, and would take the
girl to Hammerstone Market. It seemed at once to
become vitally necessary that I should see Barbara&mdash;should
let her understand, in however vague a fashion,
what had happened, and should get the clear light of
her reason upon it. Up to a certain point I had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
my way strongly, without fear and without question;
but now I had come to a point when I was afraid to
move&mdash;afraid to take any step that might involve
young Arnold Millard. One man I feared, and
feared greatly; and that man was Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>I knew he would not hesitate for a moment to denounce
me, if it served his purpose to do so. I knew
that he believed that I had killed Murray Olivant, and
I did not know how far that old vengeance with which
he had pursued me before would stir him to pursue
me again. I did not like, above all things, that secret
creeping away in the night on some unknown errand.</p>

<p>Not that I feared for myself; but that I thought I
knew enough of the boy to know that, if another were
threatened with the penalty of his crime, he would
not hesitate to step forward and tell the truth. And
in that case all that I had striven so hard to do would
be lost, and the boy's fate would be that of a certain
poor Charlie Avaline, long since forgotten.</p>

<p>I hurried to Barbara's lodging, only to find, as I
had anticipated, that she and the girl had gone. From
there I went straight to the railway station, and took
train for Hammerstone Market&mdash;still with that feeling
in my mind that I must know, before everything else,
what the boy was going to do.</p>

<p>In the train I remembered that the vessel on which
Murray Olivant was supposed to sail with me started
that morning; I wondered what was going to happen
in that direction, or whether it was already known
that we had not sailed at all. The thought of that
sent my hand to my pocket in search of the tickets;
I found that they were gone.</p>

<p>I searched every pocket wildly, striving as I did so
to remember exactly when I had had them last, and
under what circumstances. I remembered distinctly
taking them from the pocket of the dead man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
putting them into my own; knew&mdash;or thought I
knew&mdash;that I had had them at the time when Dawkins
doubted my statement about Olivant. But had I
produced them then for his inspection, or had I merely
told him that I had them? I could not be sure of
that; I went over and over the conversation of the
previous night, only to find myself more and more
muddled and vague about it. One dreadful thought
came to me: had I by any chance dropped them in
that room in Lincoln's Inn Fields where Murray
Olivant lay murdered?</p>

<p>I was making my way out of the station, when I
felt a quick touch on my arm; I looked round sharply,
and saw young Arnold Millard beside me. I suppose
my face must have shown in a moment the fear that
was in my heart for him, and for his safety; but there
was a fine assumption of astonishment in his tones
when he spoke to me.</p>

<p>"Why, Tinman, what's the matter with you?"
he demanded. "You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"What should be wrong, sir?" I asked, as we
walked together out of the station. "Have you any
news of your brother&mdash;of Mr. Olivant?" I looked
at him fully, and wondered that his eyes did not shrink
from mine.</p>

<p>"The best of news," he exclaimed. "He's shown
the white feather, Tinman; he's made up his mind
to leave the country. I'm not sorry that he's slipped
through my fingers; he wasn't worth killing, was
he?"</p>

<p>"No; God knows he wasn't worth killing," I said
passionately.</p>

<p>"His flat is shut up, and I'm told he sails this morning;
the people in the house even knew the name of
the vessel&mdash;the <i>Eaglet</i>. I wouldn't believe it at first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but the housekeeper opened the doors for me, and
let me go all over the rooms. Everything was packed
up or covered up; he's going to be away a long time,
I should think."</p>

<p>I wondered how he could lie in such a cheerful
fashion; my heart ached at the thought that I had
sacrificed myself for such a man as this. Of course,
I understood that he had a right to protect himself,
and to suspect everyone who might by any possibility
guess his secret; but I would have given anything
then to have heard one word from him that even
hinted at the truth&mdash;to have seen in his eyes the
faintest suggestion of fear. I began to understand
that in the event of Murray Olivant being identified,
that faithful servant Tinman might well hang, after
all, for what he had not done.</p>

<p>"And so I've come down here, to see if I can get
any news of poor Barbara," he went on. "I've a
shrewd suspicion that I may hear something of her;
I don't think Murray would have bolted like that,
unless he had found that the game was up, do you?</p>

<p>"Miss Barbara is down here&mdash;with her father," I
said.</p>

<p>He turned to me quickly. "How do you know
that?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;that is all," I said.</p>

<p>Presently he found my slow steps too slow for his
impatience; he excused himself, and hurried away
at a great rate in the direction of the house, leaving
me walking more slowly in his wake, and looking
sadly after him. For this was different from anything
I had anticipated; this was but a mean slipping-out
of the business, with nothing heroic about it. I
felt sorry for the child who was to trust her life to
him.</p>

<p>It was with a great sense of relief that, as I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
nearer to the house, I met the elder Barbara. She
stopped for a moment on seeing me, and then came
towards me rapidly, with her hands clasped at her
breast, looking at me. Only then did I remember,
miserably enough, on what errand I had set out
when last I had seen her, and with what threat on my
lips. I realized that my troubles were not over.</p>

<p>"My dear, you have news for me?" she whispered,
looking straight into my eyes. "Tell me everything."</p>

<p>"First tell me if you have seen the boy&mdash;young
Millard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen him; he's happy enough now.
I saw him go to Barbara; there seemed a perfect
understanding between them in a moment. They
trust each other so completely."</p>

<p>"They trust each other so completely," I replied
mechanically. "Well&mdash;perhaps that is well. Now
for my news, Barbara. What would you wish me
to tell you?"</p>

<p>"The truth," she whispered, still looking at me
intently.</p>

<p>I thought of the boy, with the brand of Cain upon
him, who was at that moment doubtless holding the
child of this Barbara in his arms, and whispering that
he loved her; and she trusted him so completely!
"You want the truth?" I responded with a smile.
"Then I have no news for you."</p>

<p>She took me in her arms&mdash;there, in that quiet
country lane; she spoke to me, as I knew, out of the
depth of her great love for me. "The truth, Charlie&mdash;the
truth to me, at least," she pleaded.</p>

<p>I saw that it had come once again to the parting
of the ways for us, just as it had done twenty years
before; I knew that for the boy's sake, and for the
sake of the girl who loved him, I must again thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
myself out of life. For I must lie to this woman, who
held me in her arms and pleaded for the truth. And
in giving her that which she must for ever believe
to be the truth, I must wound her again, as I had
wounded her long ago. "You shall know the truth,"
I said slowly&mdash;"if you will promise to do what I ask.
Promise."</p>

<p>"I will promise anything&mdash;and everything."</p>

<p>"I went away from you, meaning to kill Murray
Olivant," I said, like one repeating a lesson. "You
should know that I do not fail in such a matter. I
have killed him." She clapped her hand upon my
lips, and looked round her quickly; I took the hand,
and drew it away, and kissed it, and went on with
what I had to say. "All the world believes that he
sails this morning for the Mediterranean; it is possible
that the murder will not be discovered. That's the
truth."</p>

<p>She clung to me, shuddering; she asked me in a
whisper what it was that I wanted her to do.</p>

<p>"Go back to your husband," I said. "It is not
he that needs you, so much as the girl. She needs
you more than she ever needed you in her life before.
Will you keep your promise to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a whisper, as her arms fell to her
sides&mdash;"I will go back to him."</p>

<p>She turned away, and left me standing there, looking
after her as she went.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />

<a name="THE_HAUNTED_MAN" id="THE_HAUNTED_MAN">THE HAUNTED MAN</a></h3>


<p>While I stood there in that country lane, looking
after the woman who was going from me
for the last time, I had time for many thoughts. For
now I stood in the world more absolutely alone than
I had ever been; there was no hand I could touch
again in friendship, for even this dear hand that I
loved most of all was withheld from me. I had killed
a man once, long ago; it was my strange fate to take
the place of another man who had killed his fellow&mdash;to
bear the blame for that, even in the eyes of the
woman I loved&mdash;to suffer death for it, if necessary.</p>

<p>So much I owed to my memories&mdash;so much I owed
to the new Barbara, and to the boy who loved her,
and whom I must save from the fate that had befallen
a certain Charlie Avaline.</p>

<p>But a strange thing was to happen&mdash;something
showing the very irony of Fate&mdash;before I left that old
life behind me for ever. Some mad desire to see again
these people for whom, in a sense, I was laying down
my life&mdash;or so much of it as mattered&mdash;came upon
me; I went on, unsteadily and hesitatingly, towards
the house. It was a bleak winter day, with a rough
and surly wind playing havoc with the dead leaves
in the grounds, and whirling them up in clouds,
and tossing them upon the terrace, and against the
windows. As I pushed open the gate&mdash;to look into that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
place of my dreams for the last time&mdash;I saw a little
picture before me that seemed, as it were, to round
off all that had happened there, or all that might
happen in the future.</p>

<p>I saw young Arnold Millard and the girl standing,
arm in arm; the girl's disengaged hand was stretched
out to the woman who was her mother. That elder
Barbara seemed to be saying something to them both,
and pointing to the house. The girl was smiling;
and suddenly she turned, and drew the elder woman
towards the terrace, with the boy following. Scarcely
knowing what I did, I crept through the neglected
garden, and went towards the terrace after them;
they did not turn their heads, and they did not see
me.</p>

<p>I knew, of course, that the woman who was supposed
to have died so many years before was but keeping
her promise to me, and was on her way to confront
her husband. I felt that I must know what happened&mdash;must
understand under what circumstances,
whether of possible happiness or of misery, I left
her. I crept nearer until, as the girl and Arnold
Millard opened the narrow door at the end of the
terrace, and passed into that room I knew so well,
I was close at hand. The elder Barbara waited
outside, looking into the room, and evidently hesitating
what to do. I was within a dozen yards of
her.</p>

<p>Inside the room I saw Lucas Savell seated; the
girl was on her knees beside him, talking to him. In
the silence I heard her voice quite clearly.</p>

<p>"Dear father&mdash;only a good, kind friend, who has
been almost like a mother to me&mdash;who has helped
and protected me. I want you to see her."</p>

<p>Even as Lucas Savell feebly got to his feet, and
stared in bewilderment at his daughter, I understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
that Barbara had not told her child of the relationship
between them; that was to be left for the moment
when she should greet her husband. The elder Barbara
had passed through the doorway, and was now
inside the room; Lucas Savell was still staring in a
dazed fashion at his daughter.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," I heard him say.</p>

<p>The elder woman stepped forward into the room.
"Lucas!&mdash;Lucas Savell!" she said falteringly; and
stood still.</p>

<p>I was totally unprepared for what happened; it
was all over in a mere matter of seconds. Savell
swung round quickly, with a cry, and then took a step
towards the woman who stood just within the doorway
of the room; cried out her name in a terrible
voice, and dropped to his knees&mdash;</p>

<p>"Barbara! Oh!&mdash;my God!&mdash;Barbara!"</p>

<p>She made a swift movement towards him; I saw
him put up his hands, as though he would beat her
off; then he plunged forward on his face at her feet.
The girl was the first to reach him, and she raised him,
and called to him wildly. But he hung limply in her
arms.</p>

<p>"Father!&mdash;you called me, father!"</p>

<p>He slowly raised his head; I saw his mouth open,
the while he made a frantic effort to speak; he even
smiled, and seemed to try to raise himself in the girl's
arms. As the elder woman moved towards him, he
shrank away from her, with horror written in every
line of his face, and seemed to dread that she might
touch him; when she did, in order to assist the girl
to raise him, it was curious to see the way in which
he looked at her, like a dumb stricken thing that did
not understand. By that time I was in the room,
and my presence seemed to stir young Millard at once
to action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go and get a doctor," he said. "He's had a
stroke."</p>

<p>The elder woman and I contrived to get him upstairs
to his room, assisted by the woman who acted as
servant in the house. And while we moved him he
strove always to keep his eyes fixed on the wife who
had so mysteriously come back to him from the grave;
he watched her incessantly. More than once he contrived
to move a hand, to touch hers; and again that
puzzled expression would come over his face. Now
and then, too, his mouth would slowly open, in that
effort to speak, and then would close again.</p>

<p>The doctor came at last, and very gravely shook
his head; muttered something to the boy about old
habits and Time's revenges; predicted that the man
might live for a long time, or might die at any
moment. "One thing is very certain," said the
doctor, as he pulled on his gloves&mdash;"he'll never
speak again."</p>

<p>There was nothing that I could do there, and there
was work waiting for me in London. I felt that I
must not then leave ragged ends; I must settle firmly
upon my shoulders the burden I had taken up. I
whispered to the elder Barbara that I was going; she
came with me out of the house, and only left me at
the gate.</p>

<p>"This is the end for us, Charlie," she said; and
yet she spoke quite bravely. "My place is here, and
I shall not leave him again. I come here as the unknown
woman&mdash;the friend of my own child; for he
will never be able to say who I am, and I shall never
tell any one on my own account. And you, my dear"&mdash;she
wound her fingers about mine for a moment,
and looked at me with the old steadfast look&mdash;"what
will you do&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Barbara," I said. "I shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
back, to meet whatever fate is in store for me&mdash;and
it does not really matter, after all. I have been
greatly blessed; I have seen the dear woman I love
again, and I hold her hands now; and I once looked
upon a dreary world that held her not, because she
was supposed to be dead. And the child you love
is near you, and happiness beckons her with a sure
hand. It might have been ever so much worse,
Barbara."</p>

<p>"If it should never happen that we meet again,
Charlie, let it at least be understood that I have forgotten
and forgiven and understood all that you
have done," she said. "And now good-bye&mdash;good-bye&mdash;for
the last time!"</p>

<p>I did not dare to look back, although I knew that
she stood there, watching me as I went. It might
have unnerved me had I seen her again; and I had need
of all my nerve for what was before me. I got to
the station, and once more took train for London.
For I felt that, in the first place, I must solve the mystery
of the steamer tickets.</p>

<p>I blamed myself bitterly that I had not destroyed
them, as I had first intended. The thought that
they had got into other hands, or had even been
dropped by me in that closed room in Lincoln's Inn
Fields, haunted me; I seemed to see them found,
and inquiries made about them; and so a gradual
tracing back, to find a certain Mr. Murray Olivant who
should have sailed on the <i>Eaglet</i>. I had two causes
for dread: the one, so far as Jervis Fanshawe was
concerned, because I knew that he believed I had
killed Olivant; the second, as regarded the boy, because
I feared that he would not hesitate to fling the
blame upon me, if it happened that he was driven
into a tight corner. And, above all things, I wanted
to know what had happened behind the door of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
room in Lincoln's Inn Fields, or if any discovery had
yet been made.</p>

<p>When I got to London I found myself in the position
again of that poor Charlie Avaline who had wandered
about with the shadow of murder hanging
over him, watching for newspaper placards. I scanned
each one I came across, expecting every moment to
see a flaring headline that should seem to point directly
to me; but I saw nothing.</p>

<p>I bought a morning paper, thinking that it might
be possible for something to be in that; but again I
saw nothing. And then it struck me that, even if
the body had not been found yet, I might be running
my neck into the noose if I went back to those rooms,
and was discovered there. I remembered horribly
enough that I had a key of the outer door, and that the
only other keys were doubtless in the pocket of the dead
man. And yet I must go back there&mdash;I must know
what had happened, or if anything had yet been discovered.</p>

<p>Exactly how many times I walked up and down
the stones of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and round about
the neighbourhood, I should not like to say. For I
knew that behind the windows of one particular set
of rooms that I could see from the pavement on the
opposite side there lay a dead man; and already
some one might have been hammering at the door
of those rooms&mdash;might even have beaten it in, and
cried out what was there for all men to see. Twice
I actually walked to the door of the house, and twice
turned back, for no better reason than that a clerk or
a whistling office boy marched in at the door, and
began to climb the stairs to some office above. Once,
as I stood there irresolutely, a policeman sauntered
along towards me; stopped for a moment to look
in at the doorway of the house, and then turned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
back and stood there, staring at the cab rank opposite,
as though waiting. Sick and faint, I hurried away,
and went again on that round I had taken so many
times already.</p>

<p>It was dark, and the lamps had long been lighted,
and the last clerks and office boys had dashed out of
the various doorways, with letters for post, or intent
upon trains to be caught, when at last I summoned
up courage to creep in at that doorway, and to begin
to climb the stairs. Even then I looked back, again
and again; paused as I got to each landing, with the
absolute certainty in my own mind that some one
was following me stealthily. Once, as I stopped like
that, a door was flung open within a yard of me, and
a man, after staring at me for a moment, slammed
the door, and raced off down the stairs. Almost I
think I shrieked after him to stop, and to listen to
what I had to say. But that shriek was only, fortunately
for me, in my own imagination.</p>

<p>I reached the door at last; it seemed that I had
been travelling for hours to get to it. I listened intently
for a minute or two; then I slipped my key
into the lock, and opened the door. The little lobby
in which I stood after I had closed that outer door
was in complete darkness; for a second or two I know
that I stood there afraid to open the door of the
inner room, and yet afraid to remain where I was.</p>

<p>I opened the door at last, and stepped in boldly.
You may perhaps have some faint idea of what my
feelings were when I saw that the candle standing on
the table was alight, and the whole room flooded with
the glow from it!</p>

<p>I know that I stood for quite half a minute, staring
at the thing stupidly, and wondering what had happened,
or if I were going mad. I had found the outer
door locked, and now, when I was in the room, a death-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
silence reigned; yet here was the candle alight.
When at last I mustered courage to take a step or two
into the place, and to look round the corner of the
table, I think I fully expected to see the man with
the knife in him gone, and to know, in some horrible
fashion, that he was in that inner room, waiting for
me. It took me a long time, even after I had seen
him lying there, with that stiff hand still gripping the
hilt of the knife, to realize that he was dead, and that
he could not possibly have lighted the candle. Even
in the horror of that moment, when it dawned upon
me slowly and dreadfully that some one else was
hidden in those rooms, I know that I laughed softly
at the absurdity of the notion that the dead man
could have lighted the candle.</p>

<p>There was no sound in the place&mdash;no movement
of any kind. The chambers were very small&mdash;just the
lobby outside, and the little sitting-room, and a bedroom
beyond. The lobby was empty; the sitting-room
contained only the dead man and myself; whoever
was there must be in the bedroom beyond. I
began to form conjectures as to who might be hidden
there&mdash;going over in my mind this one and that, who
might by any possibility be interested in this matter,
or in me. Once, as I watched the door of that inner
room, there was a mad feeling in my mind that I
would blow out the candle, and make a bolt for it;
for the door of the bedroom was closed, and whoever
was there could not have seen me. Finally I did
nothing at all, but just to stand very still, wondering
what I should do. In those few minutes I seemed
to live a lifetime&mdash;to touch the depths of hope and
fear, and life and death, and even madness.</p>

<p>My horror was not decreased by seeing the door of
the bedroom begin slowly to open. It took a long time;
because whoever was opening that door half repented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of their purpose more than once. For the door
would jerk an inch or two open, and then an inch
or two back, and then would close again entirely&mdash;and
all this quite noiselessly. The thing was getting
on my nerves to that extent that I know I was on
the verge of screaming out, when I saw a hand grasp
the lintel of the doorway&mdash;a thin bony hand, that
gripped the wood tenaciously. Then the door flew
open with startling suddenness, and a face&mdash;ghastly
white, and with a dropping jaw&mdash;was thrust out into
the room&mdash;the face of Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>Even while he stared at me, I found it suddenly
necessary that I should rearrange all my ideas.
Jervis Fanshawe had not entered into my considerations
at all in regard to the murder. I had
fixed inevitably upon Arnold Millard&mdash;had followed
in imagination his every action in the matter; had
reasoned out why he should do this or that to the
point of actual certainty. And here, in these rooms
that I had left locked, was Jervis Fanshawe, whom
by no possibility could I believe had had anything
to do with the matter. I leaned upon the table, and
stared at him; and after a moment or two he came
slowly out into the room.</p>

<p>He was so afraid of me, and so appalled at the fact
of my coming there at all, that he came slowly towards
me, never taking his eyes from my face, and looking
at nothing else. It was only when, horribly enough,
he stumbled over the feet of the dead man, that he
jumped back with a cry, and seemed to recover himself.
Then he looked at me again, and over his face
stole a smile.</p>

<p>"Why, Charlie&mdash;what's wrong?" he whispered;
and the whisper seemed to shatter the silences of the
place, and to bring us both back in a moment to the
hard and stern realities of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you get in here?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He did not answer in words; he stared down at
the dead man for a moment or two, and while he did
so he fumbled in his pockets. Very slowly he drew
out something that jingled; still looking at the dead
man, he dropped on the table the three keys, tied
together with a piece of black tape. I recognized
them in a moment as the keys that had been given
me when I first paid for the rooms.</p>

<p>He looked at me as though he did not understand
the question; looked again at the keys. Then he
pointed to the dead man&mdash;and I understood. It
seemed then as though some extraordinary process
went on in my mind, so that old carefully constructed
ideas were hurled out of it, and new ones
hastily formed. I gasped, and looked at Fanshawe,
and looked at the keys; then I cried out at him.&mdash;"My
God!&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>He nodded slowly; it seemed as though he stood
there, thinking about something else, and only coming
back slowly and with difficulty to the situation
he had to face. When at last he began to speak, it
was at first in a slow dull whisper, like a man talking
to himself, and not realizing that another is listening.
It was only later, after the first moment or two, that
he began, as it were, to take me into his confidence.</p>

<p>"She seemed to call to me to do it. You remember
when she went past me like a spirit in the dark
garden&mdash;the night we knew the girl was in peril; I
first thought of it then. I put it aside for a time; I
never had any real courage for such a matter as this.
Then I saw the spirit of her again in London here&mdash;that
Barbara we both had loved, and who died years
and years ago. And then I knew clearly enough
what I had to do."</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked down at the dead man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
it seemed almost as though he went on talking to
that ghastly thing that lay at his feet.</p>

<p>"I don't think I killed you out of any real hatred
of you; it was only because I was afraid for myself.
I saw that you, if only with your lips and your lying
tongue, would harm this child, just as another man
long ago had harmed the Barbara who was dead; and
I felt that you would have to die for it, just as that
other man had died. I did not kill you because I
was afraid of what you might do; I killed you to save
my own soul. Yes&mdash;that was it; to save my own
soul."</p>

<p>He had been speaking very slowly, and quite without
emotion; but now his manner suddenly changed, and
he turned to me, and gripped my arm, and went on
speaking eagerly, in a pathetic, wistful desire to make
me understand.</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie&mdash;I saw in that the only way to atone.
Look at me, Charlie: an old man that has suffered,
and behind whom lie so many years that are broken
and unhallowed, and worse than useless. I felt that
someday&mdash;quite soon&mdash;I might be called to meet my
God; and that there&mdash;radiant, as we knew her years
ago, Charlie, in her young and innocent beauty&mdash;there
might rise up against me the woman we both loved.
She's dead, but she had nothing to fear from death.
I knew that when <i>I</i> died it would be different; there
were accusing eyes that would spring alive with old
fires to stare at me&mdash;accusing hands that would point
at me out of the darkness into which I was going.
And I prayed, or tried to pray, that God would show
me some way&mdash;some sacrifice to be offered up in the
old Bible fashion&mdash;that should atone. I pushed that
thought away from me more than once&mdash;the thought
of killing him; but I could not get rid of it. It was
always with me&mdash;and that was why I tried to learn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
you, who had done the thing once, what it was like,
and how best to set about it. For I felt that if I
could kill this man&mdash;if I could cry to the uneasy spirit
of the dead woman&mdash;'This have I done to make atonement;
this man have I killed, who would have harmed
the child so like yourself in the old years that are gone'&mdash;why,
then I felt that all would be well for me, and that
I should not see always her accusing eyes in the darkness,
or in my dreams when I slept."</p>

<p>I stared at him for what seemed a long time; it was
difficult at first for my mind to grasp this thing, to
realize what he had done. At last I asked: "Why
have you come back here?"</p>

<p>"I could not stay away," he whispered. "I
wanted to know what had happened&mdash;whether they
had found him; I was even afraid that the blow might
not have been strong enough, and that he might have
crept out&mdash;bloody and horrible&mdash;to cry out what had
been done, and to tell men who had done it. It has
taken me a long time to get back here; I've been
afraid."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I'm going away&mdash;far away," he said, looking at
me cunningly. "I haven't your courage, Charlie;
I couldn't face what they might do to me if they
found out anything about it. When I was coming
here first to kill him I did not think of that; but now
I can't bear even to try to understand in my own
mind what the rope would be like about my neck&mdash;and
the cap pulled over me&mdash;and the grey morning
shut out&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;No&mdash;no&mdash;I can't bear to think
of that. I shall escape."</p>

<p>"I think you possibly may escape unsuspected,"
I assured him gravely. "I do not think there is any
one likely to point a finger at you, and suggest that you
did it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"You think not, Charlie?" His voice was eager,
and something very like a smile was on his face. "Do
you think I might get away? I think so too; I'm going
to try. And when you come to think of it, Charlie,"
he went on, with rising spirits&mdash;"it was bravely done&mdash;finely
done. For I'm a weak old man&mdash;see these thin
hands and arms of mine&mdash;and he full of life and vigour.
Yet look at him now."</p>

<p>"Tell me how you did it," I said.</p>

<p>"It was after I had talked to you, Charlie&mdash;when I
spoke about a knife, you know&mdash;that I made up my
mind how best it could be done. I bought the knife&mdash;a
long way from here, where no one would be likely
to know me&mdash;and I chose the very night of his coming
here. It was a simple matter, after all. I came up the
stairs, and knocked at the door; after a moment or
two he opened it, cursed me for disturbing him, and
went in, with his back to me. The knife was in my
breast pocket, and I had my hand upon it; I could
have done it then&mdash;easily. But I was afraid; I did
not know where to strike. Then, when he came into
the room, and I was there with him, he suddenly
turned round, and asked me what I wanted. And
courage came back to me. I stepped up close to him,
and I said suddenly that this was what I wanted;
and I drove it in with all my force. He stood staring
at me for quite a moment, with that thing sticking
in him&mdash;staring stupidly, as if he didn't understand
what had happened. And then he laughed (or so it
seemed to me), and dropped, and died. It was horrible."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"It suddenly occurred to me that I might need to
come back here again; I must have that power, at least.
I did not dare go near him; but I found that he had
dropped the keys on the table, just where they are
now. So I took them&mdash;and I went away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>I picked up the keys, and looked at them; I was
thinking deeply. For now it seemed to me that I
had to face a new problem: the problem of what
this man Jervis Fanshawe would do. That he would
not give himself up for the crime I was certain; but I
wanted to understand whether he had determined,
in the event of discovery, to shift the blame on the
boy Arnold Millard, or on myself. I had suffered
once for this man, twenty years before&mdash;had been
drawn on to murder, practically at his bidding; I did
not mean to play the scapegoat again. In the case
of the boy it had been different; while I had believed
him guilty I had been willing enough, out of that
old romantic feeling, to take the burden on my own
shoulders. But not for Jervis Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" I asked for
the second time. "What plans have you in your
mind?"</p>

<p>He looked at me again, with that cunning expression
on his face I had seen before. "There is a vessel to
sail, on which Murray Olivant took passages for himself
and for you," he said in a whisper. "What
if I took his place, Charlie&mdash;and you came with me?"</p>

<p>"Too late," I said&mdash;"even if you had the tickets."</p>

<p>Still keeping his eyes fixed upon my face, he dived
into one of his pockets, and brought out an envelope;
opened it, and pulled out the tickets. I started, and
stared at him, and made a movement to take them
from him; but he closed the envelope quickly, and
thrust it back into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;you didn't know that, did you?" he said.
"I stole them from you while you slept; I saw my
chance there. It only occurred to me, after I had
seen you show them to Dawkins, that I might slip
away like that, and never be heard of again; I might
drop off at some foreign port, and be lost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're too late," I reminded him, with a laugh.
"The <i>Eaglet</i> sailed this morning."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," he exclaimed, dragging the envelope
out again. "Either you made a mistake in
the date, or the clerk did; the <i>Eaglet</i> sails to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>For answer he carefully pulled the tickets out, and,
keeping a grip on them, let me read the date. Sure
enough some one had blundered, for the date was that
of the following day.</p>

<p>"Now, Charlie," he whispered, laying an impressive
hand on my arm&mdash;"the way is clear. Come with me,
Charlie&mdash;Tinman, the servant, travelling with Murray
Olivant. Murray Olivant is expected on board,
and his passage is taken; Tinman, his servant, goes
with him. As for this thing that lies here"&mdash;he jerked
his head to indicate the dead man&mdash;"who is ever to
say that this is Murray Olivant. A chance, Charlie;
but all the world is made up of chances, isn't it?
Come, Charlie&mdash;the road lies clear before us."</p>

<p>"No," I said&mdash;"I have other work to do. If you
can escape, do so by all means; I will not leave
England."</p>

<p>He got his hat from that inner room, and prepared
to depart. I had put the keys back on the table, and
I saw him eyeing them; I took the key I had from
my pocket, and dropped it with the others. "It's
a great game of chance," I whispered to him, "and
you may never be discovered, after all. Come away&mdash;and
leave him there; you are safe so far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>He went to the door and opened it; at a sign from
me he waited at that outer door, to be certain that
no one was about. Then I blew out the candle, and
crept out to join him; and for a moment we stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
close together, listening. Then he opened the door,
and slipped out, and I came after him. I pulled the
door, and heard the lock click; and knew that the
ghastly thing inside was safely shut in, until some
one should break down the door, and find it.</p>

<p>We stood for a moment or two listening, and then
crept down into the quiet of Lincoln's Inn Fields.
As our feet touched the pavement Jervis Fanshawe
stopped, and looked over his shoulder back into the
dark house.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear anything, Charlie?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied. "What should we hear?"</p>

<p>"No door opening quietly?&mdash;no soft pad, pad of
feet down the stairs? Quick!&mdash;don't you hear
it?"</p>

<p>"Come away," I said abruptly; for the horror of
the thing was creeping over me again.</p>

<p>Yet before we were out of the place he had turned&mdash;not
once but many times&mdash;to look over his shoulder,
whispering to me more than once that something was
creeping along the other side&mdash;there&mdash;in the shadow
of the railings!&mdash;and didn't I see that hand against
the breast, gripping something?&mdash;and was I sure that
the door had been closed?&mdash;and would it not be better
if we went back, and listened again outside it?</p>

<p>We were well on our way back to his lodging when
he stopped, and gripped me, and cried out suddenly
that the candle had been left alight; he was sure of
it&mdash;sure that some one would see it shining through
the chinks of the door. But that I gripped him
firmly he would have set off then and there, perhaps
to burst into the place in some mad fashion, to see
what had happened. But I got him back to his
lodging, and saw him presently stretched upon the
bed, muttering and moaning to himself, and starting
up every now and then to ask me if there wasn't a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
footstep on the stairs, or a hand knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>But in the morning he was calmer, and I made him
as respectable as possible, and took him down presently
to the docks. There we found the <i>Eaglet</i>, in the
midst of much bustle and excitement, getting ready
to start; and I sent him on board, and left him there.
The last I saw of him was when the vessel was moving
away into the river, and I was standing at the dock
side, watching. And Jervis Fanshawe was leaning
over the side, with that nervous hand of his plucking
at his lips, and with his haunted eyes staring straight
through me and behind me, as though at the last he
saw Murray Olivant, with the knife in his breast,
rushing to stop him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<a name="I_FACE_THE_WORLD_AGAIN" id="I_FACE_THE_WORLD_AGAIN">I FACE THE WORLD AGAIN</a></h3>


<p>Of all that I must write of my life, as it faced me
after those tragic happenings, certain pictures
rise up in my mind, not easily to be effaced. I who
write this am poor and old, yet not broken nor downcast
any more. For, by the great grace of God, I am not
alone; there is one with me, whose tender loving eyes
look always at me, with no remembrance of any defects
or frailties&mdash;with no recollection of anything I may
have done that would have been so much better left
undone.</p>

<p>Of the pictures that rise before me as I look back,
the first is that of being absolutely alone in London,
with the fear of death upon me. The fear of death&mdash;because
the man Jervis Fanshawe had killed lay
hidden behind a frail wooden door, that might at any
moment be broken down; thereafter I was to expect
search to be made for a certain servant named Tinman,
sometime Charles Avaline, condemned to death
twenty years before for murder.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, that never happened. I
have the memory before me now of a day when I walked
the streets, and was faced suddenly by a newspaper
placard, flaring with the announcement&mdash;"Murder of an
unknown man in Lincoln's Inn Fields." Thereafter
I saw other placards&mdash;this one startlingly vivid with a
clue, this one hopeless. And I even had the temerity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to stand in a little stuffy Coroner's court, what time
twelve good men and true brought in a verdict of
murder against some person or persons unknown.
More than that, I stood one bitter winter evening
beside a pauper grave in a cemetery, and knew that
the newly turned earth covered all that was mortal
of Murray Olivant.</p>

<p>Another picture rises in my mind&mdash;so near to the
other that it seems to be part of it. I remember that
on this occasion I was in a poor eating-house in a
poor neighbourhood of London; I was looking through
the columns of a newspaper that was a day or two
old. A man as poor as I was is necessarily a little
behind the times; news filters through to him slowly
enough. And looking down the columns of this
paper I came across an item of news that was startling:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Loss of a British steamer.</span> <i>Only one survivor.</i>&mdash;The
S.S. <i>Eaglet</i>, concerning the fate of which so many
rumours have been rife of late, is now known to have
gone on the rocks off Ushant, and to have become a
total wreck. The fate of the vessel would probably
never have been known, but for the fact that a sailor
was washed ashore, and after being tended by the
good people there, was able to give some particulars
as to the wreck. It appears that the vessel went on
the rocks in one of those dense fogs peculiar to that
coast, and broke up within a very few minutes. There
is not the slightest doubt that this sailor, whose name
is given as Henry Howard, is the sole survivor of the
ill-fated vessel. It may be mentioned that among
the passengers was a young gentleman of fortune&mdash;a
Mr. Murray Olivant&mdash;who was travelling to the
Mediterranean on a pleasure cruise."</p></blockquote>

<p>I sat with the soiled paper in my hands; I read so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
much more into the paragraph than any one else could
have done. The real Murray Olivant lay in that
pauper's grave beside which I had stood, and yet
was buried as a man unknown; and here he was proclaimed
as having been lost in the wreck of the vessel
on which he was supposed to have sailed. More
than that; for the hungry sea had claimed as a victim
that man Jervis Fanshawe of the haunted eyes, who
had killed him, and had gone on that voyage in his
place. Justice has a long arm.</p>

<p>My memories after that are confused; I think I
must have suffered greatly during that winter, when
I was alone and friendless in London. In my recollections
of that time there is always a great roar and
rush of traffic in my ears, and I seem always to be
standing in the rain, or with the bitter wind ruffling
my garments; at other times I am crouching over
fires in small lodging houses, in the company of other
forlorn wretches&mdash;outcasts like myself. I am always
hungry, and I do not seem to understand what reason I
have for living at all. And I find myself, like some
uneasy ghost that has been forgotten, wandering
about old familiar places, and going over again scenes
that only I remember, and that belong only to the
past.</p>

<p>I find myself again in Lincoln's Inn Fields&mdash;unable
now to remember clearly where a certain Gavin Hockley
is&mdash;or whether I killed him, or someone else; wondering
vaguely what he had to do with a certain
Murray Olivant who died long ago&mdash;or was he drowned
at sea? I find myself&mdash;an old man, with the rain
beating upon me, and the wind driving at me&mdash;sitting
on the steps of a house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and
wondering if I dare climb the stairs, to find what
is hidden behind a locked door.</p>

<p>Another picture rises in my mind: I am in a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
clean place of many beds, and I am ill. They talk of
want and exposure, and then try to find out who I
am, and whether I have any friends. I remember
one thing, and one only: that my name is "Tinman";
I am glad to think that I have no friends, and that it
may happen that this is the end of my poor life, and
that I may finish here in peace.</p>

<p>But the spring comes, and with the spring some
stirring of life in my veins. I am so much better
that I surprise them all; although they cannot understand
why I refer to myself, over and over again,
as "No. 145." I beg that they will call me that,
because it is what I have been for twenty years. And
I ask again and again that the governor will not send
me out into a world that I have forgotten, and where
I know no one.</p>

<p>But the spring in my blood fights for me, after all;
and I am presently free, and a little grateful, perhaps,
to be able to sit in the sun, and watch the great glad
life of a great glad city all about me. And this is the
last of the pictures&mdash;for all the rest is dear reality.</p>

<p>I remember that, as I grew stronger, a sudden
passion of longing came upon me, and drew me inevitably
to the woods and the fields I had known so long
before, in a certain summer time, and had known
later with the snow upon them, and the chill winds of
winter blowing over them. The sun warmed me to life
almost as if I had renewed my youth, so that I found
myself one day&mdash;poor shabby old creature that I was&mdash;with
my feet set steadily upon the road that led to
Hammerstone Market, and with my eager eyes searching
the landscape before me to catch the first glimpse
of it.</p>

<p>I was weaker than I had imagined, and it took me
nearly two days to get to it. But I came to it at
last, on a bright spring morning&mdash;came into the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
bustle of the little country town, with the market-place
just as it had always been, and the <i>George Hotel</i>
as comfortable-looking as ever, with its doors thrown
hospitably wide open. I was tired and faint after
my long tramp, and I found in a corner of a pocket in
my shabby clothes a sixpence. I went into the place,
and ordered some bread and cheese and ale.</p>

<p>There seemed some excitement about the <i>George</i>
that morning. There was an air of every one being in
their best clothes; there was a young coachman there,
in particular, who was obviously smoking an unusual
cigar, and who had a white favour fastened to the
lapel of his coat. There was another coachman
also, more elderly and staid; and the two men were
talking with the landlord. I passed unnoticed&mdash;a
mere shabby stranger, taking his modest refreshment
in the corner.</p>

<p>"Well, an' it won't be half a bad thing to see the
old place livened up a bit," the landlord was saying.
"They do say that the young chap 'as come into a
tidy bit o' money since 'is 'alf-brother was drowned
in that wreck&mdash;a very tidy bit o' money indeed.
Well&mdash;well&mdash;that's the way o' the world: 'ere to day
an' gorn to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I mind 'er mother&mdash;Lord knows 'ow many year
ago, when I was a young chap," said the elder coachman,
rolling his cigar between his lips&mdash;"an' you take
my word for it, if this young lady ain't the very stuck
image of 'er. I've only got to shut my eyes, an' I can
see the child now&mdash;just so like the mother as ever was.
And both of 'em with the same names, mind you.
Miss Barbara then, an' Miss Barbara now."</p>

<p>I listened wonderingly; I began dimly to understand.
Coming a little nearer to them, I ventured to put a
question, and they answered me respectfully enough.</p>

<p>"There is to be a wedding to-day?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is that," exclaimed the landlord heartily.
"A quiet weddin', mind you&mdash;because you can't
exactly 'ave much fuss an' flummery with the grass
not quite grown on a grave yet, can you?"</p>

<p>"A grave?" I faltered.</p>

<p>"Ah, a grave," said the landlord, glad of a chance
to talk to a stranger. "Old Mr. Savell died some three
months back&mdash;father of the bride, you understand.
Had a stroke early in the winter, an' never recovered."</p>

<p>"Never spoke, did 'e?" asked the younger coachman.</p>

<p>"Never a word from the moment that the Lord
struck 'im down," said the landlord, with a shake of
his head. "Merciful release, in a manner o' speaking;
the young folks must 'ave their chance, after the old
'uns is put away. Now, boys, it's time you was
goin'; I'm going to give a look in at the church myself,
in time to see a bit of the bride an' the young gentleman.
Why&mdash;would you believe it&mdash;in a sense 'e belongs
here; used to stop in this very place when first 'e
came down a-courtin' the young lady. So, you see,
it's only right as the <i>George</i> should be represented,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>I found my way out of the place, and towards the
church. There was a holiday feeling in the air, and
a ringing of bells; I felt that I was strangely out of
place. A sudden impulse to hide myself came upon
me, and I went out beyond the town, and into that
green wood&mdash;beautiful now in its spring dress&mdash;that
had meant so much to me so often before. And
there for a long time I sat, with the peace of God
stealing into my heart, listening to the ringing of the
bells, and thinking gratefully that all was well&mdash;that
all was better, perhaps, because I stood outside it,
and could touch it no more.</p>

<p>Yet the bells drew me; they rang a tune in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
ears that brought me at last to my feet, and set me
upon the road to the church. There was a crowd
about it now, and much jostling and laughter; I saw
the round jolly face of the landlord of the <i>George</i>, and
he was evidently still telling any one who would listen
to him of his proprietary rights in the bridegroom.
I managed to slip into the church, and found my
way into a little curtained pew at the back of it,
from which I could watch all that was going on, and
yet remain unseen.</p>

<p>I had no eyes for any one but the girl; she came
in on the arm of an elderly man I judged to be a
family lawyer, or in some such position. She looked
very beautiful as she went slowly up the old church
to join her lover; I thought with a pang of how I had
seen her mother&mdash;looking just like this&mdash;step over these
worn stones in her bridal dress, twenty years before.
I remembered, too, how I had stood there, with a
bursting heart, and had seen her going out of my life.
I could not bear the thought of that, even then; I
knelt in my curtained pew, and hid my face in my
hands, while all the rustling and whispering went
on about me. Then the solemn service began, and
still I knelt there, as in a dream. But I was happier
then than I had ever been; for in my dream this was
poor Charlie Avaline, far back in the years, wedding
the woman he loved&mdash;thereafter to live happily, without
any shadow on his life.</p>

<p>I felt that I must see her as she came out of the
church; so much at least was due to me. So, with a
new boldness, I stepped out of the pew, and stood
there in the shadows, waiting, while she came on the
arm of her young husband down the church. And
the twenty odd years had taught me so much that I
could stand like that, and look at it all with no feeling
of envy, or bitterness for all I had suffered: only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
great gladness that this Barbara at least was to tread
a path of roses. I stood quietly there, watching her
as she came down the church; if the tears were in my
eyes, they were only there because I remembered
poor Charlie Avaline, who had stood in the same
place, and had watched that other Barbara whom he
loved.</p>

<p>She was within a couple of yards of me when she
raised her eyes, and looked straight at me. I would
have drawn back, but she was too quick for me; she
came forward at once, drawing Arnold Millard with
her, and caught at my hand. And it seemed that I
was no longer shabby and poor; all in a moment I
was greater than any one there.</p>

<p>"It's Tinman! It's dear Tinman!" she said.</p>

<p>In the strangest fashion she had disengaged herself
from her husband's arm, and was shaking my hands.
We were saying the absurdest things to each other:
I congratulating her, and wishing her well, and half
laughing and half crying in my weakness and my joy;
she murmuring over and over again that this was the
best thing of all, to see me like this at such a time.
And all about us the strange wondering faces pressing
nearer.</p>

<p>And then before them all she raised herself on
tiptoe, and kissed me on the cheek&mdash;yes, before them
all! As she went out of the church, running a little
eagerly for a step or two, to join her husband, who
was smilingly waiting, she looked back at me, and
waved her hand; and so was gone out into the
sunlight, amidst a roar of cheering. I felt strangely
alone; but that was, of course, inevitable. The Barbara
I had loved had gone for ever out of my life; she had
told me so, on that day when it had come to the parting
of the ways for us. Each of us had done our part.
I had been privileged to see the end that day, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
I must go out into the world, and live in loneliness
just so many years as might be given to me. But
I was no longer tired or hopeless; I had drunk deep of
life, and although there were so many things I would
have been glad to have had altered, there was yet so
much that was better than I could have hoped. I
would linger here for a little time, on this spring morning,
and then would go on, to take up the quiet burden
of my days.</p>

<p>I found my way back to the old house, and peered
in at the gate. All was changed here now: the garden
no longer neglected, and the house looking bright and
fresh. There was no one about, and I crept in, and
stood again on that terrace, looking into the room.
There were bright flowers there, and the place was
very different from what it had ever been before. I
came away, and found my way into that wood that
seemed to hold all my memories. I sat down there for
the last time&mdash;reviewing, as it were, my life, and looking
back to see the boy who had painted here among the
trees, and had seen coming towards him, with a smile
in her eyes, the Barbara of long ago.</p>

<p>And so it happened that I looked up presently,
and saw coming through the wood the Barbara I
loved: and it almost seemed, despite the passage of
the years, that this was the Barbara I had always
known, and who was unchanged. The heavy soiled
garment of the years dropped away from me; I was
again a man with hopes and longings; I suddenly
realized how much this dear woman was to me, and how
much we both might be, each to the other. I stood
there, bareheaded in the sunlight, holding her hands,
and looking into her eyes; and I was no longer old
or tired; I faced life again, with the spring in my
veins and in my heart.</p>

<p>"We are all alone, dear Tinman," she said, using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
that familiar name naturally. "I am the unknown
woman, who has stood beside my husband's grave,
and yet have not mourned for him; I am the woman
who has stood in God's house to day, and seen my
child married&mdash;just as I might have married poor
Charlie Avaline, years and years ago. Such a strange
life ours has been, my dear," she added softly; "it
seems almost as though you and I are left alone together
forgotten and unknown in the great world&mdash;with all
our work done."</p>

<p>"But we came to the parting of the ways before,
Barbara," I said; "there can be no going back now.
God has been very good to me: I might never have
seen you again; I might have died that shameful death
twenty years ago. But I am a felon; I am branded
with the brand of Cain; there is blood on my hands."</p>

<p>"Spilled for my sake!" she cried quickly, taking my
hands, as she had done once before, and putting her
lips to them. "And you lied to me, Charlie; you did
not kill Olivant."</p>

<p>"I did not kill Olivant," I said; "but I am guilty,
in that I set out to do it. Some one forestalled me:
some one who has died a violent death, and paid that
penalty. But that, too, was some one who loved you,
in however poor a fashion. It was Jervis Fanshawe."</p>

<p>We talked there for a long time in the woods, and
at last it seemed to me that the moment had come
when I must part from her. For I would not link my
life with hers; on that point I was resolute. Yet
she clung to me, and told me what was in her heart.</p>

<p>"Years ago, Charlie, when I knew that they would
not kill you, but that you must live out your life in
bitter servitude for what you had done for me, I
made up my mind that there was a duty before me,
and that I was called to it inevitably. It seemed to
me then that I must consecrate what was left of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
life to you, and to the memory of you; your love for
me had been so great a thing that in a sense I belonged
to you, if only in spirit. Dear, you came back to me
wonderfully from out of your prison; you fought for
me again; you were ready to lay down your life for
that other Barbara, who was like the Barbara you
had loved. I am lonely now&mdash;lonely and unknown;
do not send me away from you!"</p>

<p>"I am so poor a thing for any woman to cling to,"
I said pitifully. "I have been down to the depths;
I am a thing of poverty, and shame, and degradation."</p>

<p>"You are the man I love," she said, putting her arms
about me. "There is a great world waiting for us&mdash;a
world of sunshine, and life, and laughter; you shall
learn to forget all the horror through which you have
passed. Charlie, I took your name once&mdash;glad and
proud to bear it; let me take it now, and keep it to
the end."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have set down here the record of my poor life, so far
as I have lived it; yet it is as a slate, crowded with the
awkward writing of a child, and much of it obliterated
and rubbed out&mdash;blotted a little here and there with
tears. Much, too, is being obliterated day by day of
the sorrow and the misery of it; for a woman's hand
steals over mine sometimes, and will not let me write
of the sorrowful part that has been mine, and is mine
no longer. I have been greatly blessed; I pray my
God that when the time comes that He calls me to
answer for my great sin, it may happen that at the
last her strong warm hand holds mine, and points
me to the road&mdash;that her strong brave lips whisper to
me what I shall say.</p>
